Hi Bill and Yan,

Would you be available Thursday at 3pm (or another time, if not) to discuss with Fan and I about the Kelvin Helmholtz instability? We are planning on applying PiD to our KH simulation and it would be very helpful to discuss a plan for this project and get everyone on the same page.

Happy new year!
Josh
