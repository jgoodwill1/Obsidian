Here, we attempt the evaluation of the small-scale velocity gradient tensor for a case study of space plasma turbulence, observed in the Earth's magnetosheath region by the CLUSTER mission. In detail, we investigate the joint statistics P(R, Q) of the velocity gradient geometric invariants R and Q, and find that this P(R, Q) is similar to that of the low end of the inertial range for fluid turbulence, with a pronounced increase in the statistics along the so-called Vieillefosse tail.

Plots of the joint probability density functions of the invariants of the rate of strain and velocity gradient tensors indicated that away from the wall region, the fine-scale motions in the flow have many characteristics in common with a variety of other turbulent and transitional flows: the intermediate principal strain rate tended to be positive at sites of high viscous dissipation of kinetic energy, while the invariants of the velocity gradient tensor showed that a preference existed for stable focus/stretching and unstable node/saddle/saddle topologies. Visualization of regions in the flow with stable focus/stretching topologies revealed arrays of discrete downstream-leaning flow structures which originated near the wall and penetrated into the outer region of the flow. In all regions of the flow, there was a strong preference for the vorticity to be aligned with the intermediate principal strain rate direction, with the effect increasing near the walls in response to boundary conditions.},

   abstract = {Since the availability of data from direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence, researchers have utilized the joint PDFs of invariants of the velocity gradient tensor to study the geometry of small-scale motions of turbulence. However, the joint PDFs only give an instantaneous static representation of the properties of fluid particles and dynamical Lagrangian information cannot be extracted. In this paper, the Lagrangian evolution of the invariants of the velocity gradient tensor is studied using conditional mean trajectories (CMT). These CMT are derived using the concept of the conditional mean time rate of change of invariants calculated from a numerical simulation of isotropic turbulence. The study of the CMT in the invariant space (RA, QA) of the velocity-gradient tensor, invariant space (RS, QS) of the rate-of-strain tensor, and invariant space (RW, QW) of the rate-of-rotation tensor show that the mean evolution in the (Σ, QW) phase plane, where Σ is the vortex stretching, is cyclic with a characteristic period similar to that found by Martin et al. (1998) in the cyclic mean evolution of the CMT in the (RA, QA) phase plane. Conditional mean trajectories in the (Σ, QW) phase plane suggest that the initial reduction of QW in regions of high QW is due to viscous diffusion and that vorticity contraction only plays a secondary role subsequent to this initial decay. It is also found that in regions of the flow with small values of QW, the local values of QW do not begin to increase, even in the presence of self-stretching, until a certain self-stretching rate threshold is reached, i.e. when Σ≈0.25 〈QW〉1/2. This study also shows that in regions where the kinematic vorticity number (as defined by Truesdell 1954) is low, the local value of dissipation tends to increase in the mean as observed from a Lagrangian frame of reference. However, in regions where the kinematic vorticity number is high, the local value of enstrophy tends to decrease. From the CMT in the (−QS, RS phase plane, it is also deduced that for large values of dissipation, there is a tendency for fluid particles to evolve towards having a positive local value of the intermediate principal rate of strain.},

   abstract = { Wind spacecraft measurements are analyzed to obtain a current sheet (CS) normal width d cs distribution of 3374 confirmed magnetic reconnection exhausts in the ecliptic plane of the solar wind at 1 au. The d cs distribution displays a nearly exponential decay from a peak at d cs = 25 d  i  to a median at d cs = 85 d  i  and a 95th percentile at d cs = 905 d  i  with a maximum exhaust width at d cs = 8077 d  i  . A magnetic field θ -rotation angle distribution increases linearly from a relatively few high-shear events toward a broad peak at 35° < θ < 65°. The azimuthal ϕ angles of the CS normal directions of 430 thick d cs ≥ 500 d  i  exhausts are consistent with a dominant Parker-spiral magnetic field and a CS normal along the ortho-Parker direction. The CS normal orientations of 370 kinetic-scale d cs < 25 d  i  exhausts are isotropic in contrast, and likely associated with Alfvénic solar wind turbulence. We propose that the alignment of exhaust normal directions from narrow d cs ∼ 15–25 d  i  widths to well beyond d cs ∼ 500 d  i  with an ortho-Parker azimuthal direction of a large-scale heliospheric current sheet (HCS) is a consequence of CS bifurcation and turbulence within the HCS exhaust that may trigger reconnection of the adjacent pair of bifurcated CSs. The proposed HCS-avalanche scenario suggests that the underlying large-scale parent HCS closer to the Sun evolves with heliocentric distance to fracture into many, more or less aligned, secondary CSs due to reconnection. A few wide exhaust-associated HCS-like CSs could represent a population of HCSs that failed to reconnect as frequently between the Sun and 1 au as other HCSs. },

   abstract = {13 Despite decades of study of high-temperature weakly-collisional plasmas, a complete understanding 14 of how energy is transferred between particles and fields in turbulent plasmas remains elusive. Two 15 major questions in this regard are how fluid-scale energy transfer rates, associated with turbulence, 16 connect with kinetic-scale dissipation, and what controls the fraction of dissipation on different charged 17 species. Although the rate of cascade has long been recognized as a limiting factor in the heating rate at 18 kinetic scales, there has not been direct evidence correlating the heating rate with MHD-scale cascade 19 rates. Using kinetic simulations and in-situ spacecraft data, we show that the fluid-scale energy flux 20 indeed accounts for the total energy dissipated at kinetic scales. A phenomenology, based on disruption 21 of proton gyromotion by fluctuating electric fields that are produced in turbulence at proton scales, 22 argues that the proton versus electron heating is controlled by the ratio of the non-linear time scale 23 to the proton-cyclotron time and by the plasma beta. The proposed scalings are supported by the 24 simulations and observations. 25},

ABSTRACT Turbulent plasmas generate a multitude of thin current structures that can be sites for magnetic reconnection. The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission has recently enabled the detailed examination of such turbulent current structures in Earth's magnetosheath and revealed that a novel type of reconnection, known as electron-only reconnection, can occur. In electron-only reconnection, ions do not have enough space to couple to the newly reconnected magnetic fields, suppressing ion jet formation and resulting in thinner sub-proton-scale current structures with faster super-Alfv enic electron jets. In this study, MMS observations are used to examine how the magnetic correlation length (k C) of the turbulence, which characterizes the size of the large-scale magnetic structures and constrains the length of the current sheets formed, influences the nature of turbulence-driven reconnection. We systematically identify 256 reconnection events across 60 intervals of magnetosheath turbulence. Most events do not appear to have ion jets; however, 18 events are identified with ion jets that are at least partially coupled to the reconnected magnetic field. The current sheet thickness and electron jet speed have a weak anti-correlation, with faster electron jets at thinner current sheets. When k C 20 ion inertial lengths, as is typical near the sub-solar magnetosheath, a tendency for thinner current sheets and potentially faster electron jets is present. The results are consistent with electron-only reconnection being more prevalent for turbulent plasmas with relatively short k C and may be relevant to the nonlinear dynamics and energy dissipation in turbulent plasmas.

   abstract = {This (self-contained and aspiring to pedagogy) review of scaling theories of MHD turbulence aims to put the developments of the last few years in the context of the canonical time line (from Kolmogorov to Iroshnikov-Kraichnan to Goldreich-Sridhar to Boldyrev). It is argued that Beresnyak's (valid) objection that Boldyrev's alignment theory, at least in its original form, violates the RMHD rescaling symmetry can be reconciled with alignment if the latter is understood as an intermittency effect. Boldyrev's scalings, a version of which is recovered in this interpretation, and the concept of dynamic alignment (equivalently, local 3D anisotropy) are thus an example of a qualitative, physical theory of intermittency in a turbulent system. The emergence of aligned structures naturally brings into play reconnection physics and thus the theory of MHD turbulence becomes intertwined with the physics of tearing, current-sheet disruption and plasmoid formation. Recent work on these subjects by Loureiro, Mallet et al. is reviewed and it is argued that we may, as a result, finally have a reasonably complete picture of the MHD turbulent cascade (forced, balanced, and in the presence of a strong mean field) all the way to the dissipation scale. This picture appears to reconcile Beresnyak's advocacy of the Kolmogorov scaling of the dissipation cutoff (as Re 3/4) with Boldyrev's aligned cascade. It turns out also that these ideas open the door to some progress in understanding MHD turbulence without a mean field-MHD dynamo-whose saturated state is argued to be controlled by reconnection and to contain, at small scales, a tearing-mediated cascade very similar to its strong-mean-field counterpart (this is a new result). On the margins of this core narrative, standard weak-MHD-turbulence theory is argued to require some adjustment-and a new scheme for such an adjustment is proposed-to take account of the determining part that a spontaneously emergent 2D condensate plays in mediating the Alfvén-wave cascade from a weakly-interacting state to a strongly turbulent (critically balanced) one. This completes the picture of the MHD cascade at large scales. A number of outstanding issues are surveyed, most of them concerning variants of MHD turbulence featuring various imbalances: between the two Elsasser fields ("cross-helicity") or between velocity and magnetic field ("residual energy"); subviscous and decaying regimes of MHD turbulence (where there has been dramatic progress recently and reconnection again turns out to feature prominently) are also reviewed under this heading. Some new, if often tentative, ideas about these regimes are proposed along the way (a new theory of imbalanced turbulence amongst them). Finally, it is argued that the natural direction of research is now away from the fluid MHD theory and into kinetic territory-and then, possibly, back again. The review lays no claim to objectivity or completeness, focusing on topics and views that the author finds most appealing at the present moment. †},

We compare several energy dissipation estimates based on energy transfer processes in plasma turbulence and provide justification for the pressure–strain interaction as a direct estimate of the energy dissipation rate. The global and scale-by-scale energy balances are examined in 2.5D and 3D kinetic simulations. We show that the global internal energy increase and the temperature enhancement of each species are directly tracked by the pressure–strain interaction. The incompressive part of the pressure–strain interaction dominates over its compressive part in all simulations considered. The scale-by-scale energy balance is quantified by scale filtered Vlasov–Maxwell equations, a kinetic plasma approach, and the lag dependent von Kármán–Howarth equation, an approach based on fluid models. We find that the energy balance is exactly satisfied across all scales, but the lack of a well-defined inertial range influences the distribution of the energy budget among different terms in the inertial range. Therefore, the widespread use of the Yaglom relation in estimating the dissipation rate is questionable in some cases, especially when the scale separation in the system is not clearly defined. In contrast, the pressure–strain interaction balances exactly the dissipation rate at kinetic scales regardless of the scale separation.},

We find that the normalized global reconnection rate $\sim 0.01 - 0.13$, weakly dependent on $S$. Global reconnection with the classic inflow/outflow configurations is observed, and 3D flux ropes are hierarchically formed and ejected from reconnection regions. A statistical separation of the reconnected magnetic field lines follows a super-diffusive behavior, from which the rate is measured to be very similar to that obtained from the mixing of tracer populations. We find that the reconnection rate scales roughly linearly with the turbulence level during the peak of reconnection. This scaling is consistent with the turbulence properties produced by both the externally driven and self-generation processes. These results imply that large-scale thin current sheets tend to undergo rigorous reconnection.},

As examples, we discuss simulation studies of the formation and dynamics of dark solitons and quantum vortices, and of nonlinear interactions between intense circularly polarized electromagnetic (CPEM) waves and electron plasma oscillations (EPOs) in dense quantumelectron plasmas with immobile ions. The electron dynamics of dark solitons and quantum vortices is governed by a pair of equations comprising the nonlinear Schrödinger and Poisson system of equations. Both dark solitons and singly charged electron vortices are robust, and the latter tend to form pairs of oppositely charged vortices. The two-dimensional quantum-electron vortex pairs survive during collisions under the change of partners. The dynamicsof the CPEM waves is governed by a nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which is nonlinearly coupled with the Schrödinger equation of the EPOs via the relativistic ponderomotive force, the relativistic electron mass increase in the CPEM field, and the electron density fluctuations. The present governing equations in one-spatial dimension admit stationary solutions in the form of dark solitons. The nonlinear equations also depict trapping of localized CPEM wave envelopes in the electron density holes that are associated with a positive potential profile. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Black holes drive powerful plasma jets to relativistic velocities. This plasma should be collisionless, and self-consistently supplied by pair creation near the horizon. We present general-relativistic collisionless plasma simulations of Kerr-black-hole magnetospheres which begin from vacuum, inject e AE pairs based on local unscreened electric fields, and reach steady states with electromagnetically powered Blandford-Znajek jets and persistent current sheets. Particles with negative energy at infinity are a general feature, and can contribute significantly to black-hole rotational-energy extraction in a variant of the Penrose process. The generated plasma distribution depends on the pair-creation environment, and we describe two distinct realizations of the force-free electrodynamic solution. This sensitivity suggests that plasma kinetics will be useful in interpreting future horizon-resolving submillimeter and infrared observations. The relativistic jets of plasma emanating from active galactic nuclei and x-ray binary systems are widely thought to be driven by magnetic fields threading a rotating black hole, known as the Blandford-Znajek mechanism [1]. This process is generally studied using magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a fluid approximation for the plasma. While MHD has facilitated significant progress in understanding black-hole accretion and jet production [2-7], it suffers several shortcomings which limit its descriptive power for this problem; for example, the pair-creation process which supplies the jet with electron-positron plasma [8-14] cannot be captured within MHD, which therefore cannot predict the jet's mass loading. Furthermore, the jets have low densities and hence particles have large mean free paths between two-particle collisions. The plasma is effectively collisionless, as is that in many low-luminosity black-hole accretion flows, including those of Sgr A* and M87 [15,16], the targets of ongoing campaigns to resolve horizon-scale structures by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) [17,18] and GRAVITY [19,20]. Collisionless plasmas support complex behavior that can only be reflected by the full system of plasma kinetics, which can self-consistently describe the nonideal un-screened electric field, pair creation, particle acceleration, and the emission of observable radiation. Recently, there has been progress on local, one-dimensional simulations of the electrostatic physics of black holes' vacuum gaps [21-23], which must be embedded in an assumed field and current configuration. Global models are required to self-consistently include the feedback of the plasma on the magnetosphere, and have been used to study Earth's magnetosphere [24,25] and those of radio pulsars [26,27]. Here we present the first global, multidimensional kinetic simulations of black-hole magnetospheres, and include all general-relativistic effects in both particles and fields. We solve the kinetic system using the particle-in-cell approach, and use geometrized units with G ¼ M ¼ c ¼ 1, where M is the black hole's mass; lengths are given in units of r g ¼ GM=c 2 , and times are in r g =c. B and D are the magnetic and electric fields measured by the local fiducial observers (FIDOs), which are everywhere normal to spatial hypersurfaces. See the Supplemental Material for a description of the numerical method [28]. Our initial field configuration is Wald's stationary vacuum solution for a rotating black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field, aligned with the hole's angular-momentum vector, which includes the electric field generated by spacetime rotation [33]. There are no particles in the initial state. We use the Kerr metric with a high spin parameter, a ¼ 0.999, to maximize the volume of the ergosphere, and employ the Kerr-Schild spacetime foliation in spherical coordinates (r, θ, ϕ). Here we focus on two high-resolution simulations; we also performed several runs at lower resolution to infer the dependence on various parameters. We set the field strength at infinity to B 0 ¼ 10 3 m=jej, so moderately relativistic particles initially have Larmor radii r L;0 ∼ 10 −3 and gyrofrequencies Ω B 0 ¼ 10 3 ; m and e are the particle mass and charge. This provides a reference scale for many quantities, such as the Goldreich-Julian number density n 0 ¼ Ω H B 0 =4πe, where Ω H ¼ a=ðr 2 H þ a 2 Þ is the angular velocity of the horizon at r ¼ r H , and the magnetization σ 0 ¼ B 2 0 =4πn 0 m ¼ Ω B 0 =Ω H ≈ 2000.

   abstract = {Identifying how energy transfer proceeds from macroscales down to microscales in collisionless plasmas is at the forefront of astrophysics and space physics. It provides information on the evolution of involved plasma systems and the generation of high-energy particles in the universe. Here we report two cross-scale energy-transfer events observed by NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft in Earth’s magnetosphere. In these events, hot ions simultaneously undergo interactions with macroscale (~ $$\{10\}^\{5\}$$ km) ultra-low-frequency waves and microscale ( $$\sim \{10\}^\{3\}$$ km) electromagnetic-ion-cyclotron (EMIC) waves. The cross-scale interactions cause energy to directly transfer from macroscales to microscales, and finally dissipate at microscales via EMIC-wave-induced ion energization. The direct measurements of the energy transfer rate in the second event confirm the efficiency of this cross-scale transfer process, whose timescale is estimated to be roughly ten EMIC-wave periods about (1 min). Therefore, these observations experimentally demonstrate that simultaneous macroscale and microscale wave-ion interactions provide an efficient mechanism for cross-scale energy transfer and plasma energization in astrophysical and space plasmas. Cross-scale energy transfers in collisionless plasmas help understanding involved mechanisms. Here, the authors show simultaneous macro- and micro-scale wave-ion interactions provide an efficient mechanism for cross-scale energy transfer and plasma energization in astrophysical and space plasmas.},

   abstract = {Magnetized turbulence and magnetic reconnection are often invoked to explain the nonthermal emission observed from a wide variety of astrophysical sources. By means of fully-kinetic 2D and 3D PIC simulations, we investigate the interplay between turbulence and reconnection in generating nonthermal particles in magnetically-dominated pair plasmas. A generic by-product of the turbulence evolution is the generation of a nonthermal particle spectrum with a power-law energy range. The power-law slope $p$ is harder for larger magnetizations and stronger turbulence fluctuations, and it can be as hard as $p < 2$. The Larmor radius of particles at the high-energy cutoff is comparable to the size $l$ of the largest eddies. Plasmoid-mediated reconnection, which self-consistently occurs in the turbulent plasma, controls the physics of particle injection. Then, particles are further accelerated by stochastic scattering off turbulent fluctuations. The work done by parallel electric fields - naturally expected in reconnection layers - is responsible for most of the initial energy increase, and is proportional to the magnetization $\sigma$ of the system, while the subsequent energy gain, which dominates the overall energization of high-energy particles, is powered by the perpendicular electric fields of turbulent fluctuations. The two-stage acceleration process leaves an imprint in the particle pitch-angle distribution: low-energy particles are aligned with the field, while the highest energy particles move preferentially orthogonal to it. The energy diffusion coefficient of stochastic acceleration scales as $D_\gamma\sim 0.1\sigma(c/l)\gamma^2$, where $\gamma$ is the particle Lorentz factor. This results in fast acceleration timescales $t_\{acc\}\sim (3/\sigma)\,l/c$. Our findings have important implications for understanding the generation of nonthermal particles in high-energy astrophysical sources.},

In this Letter, we study the role of the plasmoid instability in two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence by means of high-resolution direct numerical simulations. At a sufficiently large magnetic Reynolds number (R m ¼ 10 6), the combined effects of dynamic alignment and turbulent intermittency lead to a copious formation of plasmoids in a multitude of intense current sheets. The disruption of current sheet structures facilitates the energy cascade towards small scales, leading to the breaking and steepening of the energy spectrum. In the plasmoid-mediated regime, the energy spectrum displays a scaling that is close to the spectral index −2.2 as proposed by recent analytic theories. We also demonstrate that the scale-dependent dynamic alignment exists in 2D MHD turbulence and the corresponding slope of the alignment angle is close to 0.25.},

   abstract = {A Hybrid Vlasov–Maxwell (HVM) model is presented and recent results about the link between kinetic effects and turbulence are reviewed. Using five-dimensional (2D in space and 3D in the velocity space) simulations of plasma turbulence, it is found that kinetic effects (or non-fluid effects) manifest through the deformation of the proton velocity distribution function (DF), with patterns of non-Maxwellian features being concentrated near regions of strong magnetic gradients. The direction of the proper temperature anisotropy, calculated in the main reference frame of the distribution itself, has a finite probability of being along or across the ambient magnetic field, in general agreement with the classical definition of anisotropy T⊥/T∥ (where subscripts refer to the magnetic field direction). Adopting the latter conventional definition, by varying the global plasma beta (β) and fluctuation level, simulations explore distinct regions of the space given by T⊥/T∥ and β∥, recovering solar wind observations. Moreover, as in the solar wind, HVM simulations suggest that proton anisotropy is not only associated with magnetic intermittent events, but also with gradient-type structures in the flow and in the density. The role of alpha particles is reviewed using multi-ion kinetic simulations, revealing a similarity between proton and helium non-Maxwellian effects. The techniques presented here are applied to 1D spacecraft-like analysis, establishing a link between non-fluid phenomena and solar wind magnetic discontinuities. Finally, the dimensionality of turbulence is investigated, for the first time, via 6D HVM simulations (3D in both spaces). These preliminary results provide support for several previously reported studies based on 2.5D simulations, confirming several basic conclusions. This connection between kinetic features and turbulence open a new path on the study of processes such as heating, particle acceleration, and temperature-anisotropy, commonly observed in space plasmas.},

   abstract = {The theory of nearly incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (NI MHD) was developed largely in the early 1990s, together with an important extension to inhomogeneous flows in 2010. Much of the focus in the earlier work was to understand the apparent incompressibility of the solar wind and other plasma environments, and the relationship of density fluctuations to apparently incompressible manifestations of turbulence in the solar wind and interstellar medium. Further important predictions about the “dimensionality” of solar wind turbulence and its relationship to the plasma beta were made and subsequently confirmed observationally. However, despite the initial success of NI MHD in describing fluctuations in the solar wind, a detailed application to solar wind turbulence has not been undertaken. Here, we use the equations of NI MHD to describe solar wind turbulence, rewriting the NI MHD system in terms of Elsässer variables. Distinct descriptions of 2D and slab turbulence emerge naturally from the Elsässer formulation, as do the nonlinear couplings between 2D and slab components. For plasma beta order 1 or less regions, predictions for 2D and slab spectra result from the NI MHD description, and predictions for the spectral characteristics of density fluctuations can be made. We conclude by presenting a NI MHD formulation describing the transport of majority 2D and minority slab turbulence throughout the solar wind. A preliminary comparison of theory and observations is presented.},

   abstract = {Numerical simulations and experimental results have shown that current sheets formation in space plasmas can be associated with enhanced vorticity. Also, in simulations the generation of such structures is associated with strong plasma heating. Here, we compare four-point measurements in the terrestrial magnetosheath turbulence from the Multiscale magnetospheric mission (MMS) of the flow vorticity and the magnetic field curlometer versus their corresponding one-point proxies PVI(V) and PVI(B) based on the Partial Variance of Increments (PVI) method. We show that the one-point proxies are sufficiently precise in identifying not only the generic features of the current sheets and vortices statistically, but also their appearance in groups associated with plasma heating. The method has been further applied to the region of the turbulent sheath of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) observed at L1 by WIND spacecraft. We observe current sheets and vorticity associated heating in larger groups (blobs), which so far have not been considered in the literature on turbulent data analysis. The blobs represent extended spatial regions of activity with enhanced regional correlations between the occurrence of conditioned currents and vorticity, which at the same time are also correlated with enhanced temperatures. This heating mechanism is substantially different from the plasma heating in the vicinity of the ICME shock, where plasma beta is strongly fluctuating and there is no vorticity. The proposed method describes a new pathway for linking the plasma heating and plasma turbulence, and it is relevant to in-situ observations when only single spacecraft measurements are available.},

   abstract = { Turbulence is often invoked to explain the origin of nonthermal particles in space and astrophysical plasmas. By means of 3D fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that turbulence in low- β plasmas ( β is the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure) accelerates ions and electrons into a nonthermal energy distribution with a power-law energy range. The ion spectrum is harder than the electron one, and both distributions get steeper for higher β . We show that the energization of electrons is accompanied by a significant energy-dependent pitch-angle anisotropy, with most electrons moving parallel to the local magnetic field, while ions stay roughly isotropic. We demonstrate that particle injection from the thermal pool occurs in regions of high current density. Parallel electric fields associated with magnetic reconnection are responsible for the initial energy gain of electrons, whereas perpendicular electric fields control the overall energization of ions. Our findings have important implications for the origin of nonthermal particles in space and astrophysical plasmas. },

important process for the efficient production of nonthermal particles and
high-energy emissions. Using fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we
investigate how guide-field strength and domain size affect characteristic
spectral features and acceleration processes. We study two stages of
acceleration: energization up until the injection energy $\gamma_\{\rm inj\}$ and
further acceleration that generates a power-law spectrum. Stronger guide fields
increase the power-law index and $\gamma_\{\rm inj\}$, which suppresses
acceleration efficiency. These quantities seemingly converge with increasing
domain size, suggesting that our findings can be extended to large-scale
systems. We find that three distinct mechanisms contribute to acceleration
during injection: particle streaming along the parallel electric field, Fermi
reflection, and the pickup process. Fermi and pickup processes, related to the
electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field, govern the injection for
weak guide fields and larger domains. Meanwhile, parallel electric fields are
important for injection in the strong guide field regime. In the post-injection
stage, we find that perpendicular electric fields dominate particle
acceleration in the weak guide field regime, whereas parallel electric fields
control acceleration for strong guide fields. These findings will help explain
the nonthermal acceleration and emissions in high-energy astrophysics,

The initial condition is an ensemble of long-wavelength, counter-propagating, shear-Alfvén waves, which interact and rapidly generate strong MHD turbulence. The total energy is conserved and the rate of turbulent energy decay is very similar in both codes, although the fluid code has numerical dissipation whereas the kinetic code has kinetic dissipation. The inertial range power spectrum index is similar in both the codes. The fluid code shows a perpendicular wavenumber spectral slope of k −1.3 ⊥. The kinetic code shows a spectral slope of k −1.5 ⊥ for smaller simulation domain, and k −1.3 ⊥ for larger domain. We estimate that collisionless damping mechanisms in the kinetic code can account for the dissipation of the observed nonlinear energy cascade. Current sheets are geometrically characterized. Their lengths and widths are in good agreement between the two codes. The length scales linearly with the driving scale of the turbulence. In the fluid code, their thickness is determined by the grid resolution as there is no explicit diffusivity. In the kinetic code, their thickness is very close to the skin-depth, irrespective of the grid resolution. This work shows that kinetic codes can reproduce the MHD inertial range dynamics at large scales, while at the same time capturing important kinetic physics at small scales.},

When fluctuation energy is injected on scales sufficiently close to ion-kinetic scales, the ions efficiently become de-magnetized and electron-scale current sheets largely dominate the distribution of the emerging current structures, in contrast to the usual picture, where a full hierarchy of structure sizes is generally observed. These current sheets are shown to be the sites of electron-only reconnection (e-rec), in which the usual electron exhausts are unaccompanied by ion outflows and which are in qualitative agreement with those recently observed by MMS in the Earth's turbulent magnetosheath, downstream of the bow shock. Some features of the e-rec phenomenology are shown to be consistent with an electron magnetohydrodynamic description. Simulations suggest that this regime of collisionless reconnection may be found in turbulent systems where plasma processes, such as micro-instabilities and/or shocks, overpower the more customary turbulent cascade by directly injecting energy close to the ion-kinetic scales.},

   abstract = {Observed turbulence in space and astrophysics is expected to involve cascade and subsequent dissipation and heating. Contrary to standard collisional fluid turbulence, the weakly collisional magnetized plasma cascade may involve several channels of energy conversion, interchange, and spatial transport, leading eventually to the production of internal energy. This paper describes these channels of transfer and conversion, collectively amounting to a complex generalization of the Kolmogorov cascade. Channels may be described using compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and multispecies Vlasov-Maxwell formulations. Key steps are conservative transport of energy in space, parallel incompressible and compressible cascades in scale, electromagnetic work on particles driving macroscopic and microscopic flows, and pressure-strain interactions, both compressive and shear-like, that produce internal energy. A significant contrast with the collisional case is that the steps leading to the disappearance of large-scale energy in favor of internal energy are formally reversible. This property motivates a discussion of entropy, reversibility, and the relationship between dissipation with collisions and in the Vlasov system without collisions. Where feasible, examples are given from MHD and Particle in Cell simulations and from MMS observations.},

   abstract = {A new measure to identify a small-scale dissipation region in collisionless magnetic reconnection is proposed. The energy transfer from the electromagnetic field to plasmas in the electron's rest frame is formulated as a Lorentz-invariant scalar quantity. The measure is tested by two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations in typical configurations: symmetric and asymmetric reconnection, with and without the guide field. The innermost region surrounding the reconnection site is accurately located in all cases. We further discuss implications for nonideal MHD dissipation. Magnetic reconnection [1] is a fundamental process in many plasma systems, ranging from laboratory and solar-terrestrial environments to extreme astrophysical settings. The violation of the ideal condition, E þ v Â B Þ 0, is essential to allow the magnetic flux transport across the reconnection point. The critical ''diffusion region'' (DR) where the ideal condition is violated is of strong interest for understanding the key mechanism of reconnection. In col-lisionless plasmas, since ions decouple first from the magnetic fields, it is thought that the DR consists of an ion-scale outer region and an electron-scale inner region. In two-dimensional (2D) reconnection problems in the x-z plane, a popular criterion to identify the innermost ''electron diffusion region'' (EDR) is the out-of-plane component of the electron nonideal condition, E Ã y Þ 0, where E Ã ¼ E þ v e Â B ¼ À 1 n e q r Á P $ e À m e q dv e dt ; (1) and P $ e the electron pressure tensor. In particular, it is known that the divergence of the pressure tensor sustains a finite E y ¼ E Ã y at the reconnection point, arising from local electron dynamics [2,3]. Recent large-scale particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shed light on the electron-scale structures around the reconnection site. Earlier investigations [4,5] found that the EDR identified by E Ã y Þ 0 [4] or the out-of-plane electron velocity [5] extends toward the outflow directions. Previous research has suggested that the EDR has a two-scale substructure: the inner EDR of E Ã y > 0 and the outer EDR of E Ã y < 0 with a super-Alfvénic electron jet [6,7]. Satellite observations found similar signatures far downstream of the reconnection site [8]. The roles of these EDRs are still under debate; however, there is a growing consensus that only the inner EDR or a similar small-scale region should control the reconnection rate [7,9,10]. Importantly, it was recently argued that the outer EDR is non-or only weakly dissipative, because the super-Alfvénic jet and E Ã y Þ 0 condition stem from projections of the diamagnetic electron current in a suitably rotated frame [10]. Meanwhile, a serious question has been raised by numerical investigations on asymmetric reconnection, whose two inflow regions have different properties such as in reconnection at the magnetopause [11,12]. It was found that various quantities including E Ã fail to locate the reconnection site in asymmetric reconnection, especially in the presence of an out-of-plane guide field [11]. Considering the debate on inner or outer EDRs and the puzzling results in asymmetric reconnection, it does not seem that E Ã Þ 0 is a good identifier of the critical region. In this Letter, we propose a new measure to identify a small, physically significant region surrounding the recon-nection site. We construct our measure based on the following three theoretical requirements. First, we are guided by the notion that dissipation should be related to nonideal energy conversion. Second, we desire a scalar quantity. If we use a specific component of a vector, we have to choose an appropriately rotated frame [10]. Using a scalar quantity instead, we do not need to find the right rotation in a complicated magnetic geometry. Third, it should be insensitive to the relative motion between the observer and the reconnection site. For example, the reconnection site can retreat away [13], or, for example, the entire reconnection system may flap over a satellite due to the magnetospheric motion. Our strategy is as follows. We choose a frame that can be uniquely specified by the observer. Among several candidates , we choose the rest frame of an electron's bulk motion because it would be the best one to characterize electron-scale structures. Next we consider the energy transfer from the field to plasmas in this frame, which is a scalar quantity. We then expand it with observer-frame quantities. The obtained measure meets all three requirements. It is a Lorentz invariant (frame-independent scalar) and is related to the nonideal energy transfer. We follow the spacelike convention (À , þ, þ, þ).},

   abstract = {In this paper we formulate a new particle-in-cell method for the
Vlasov-Maxwell system. Using the Lorenz gauge condition, Maxwell's equations
for the electromagnetic fields are written as a collection of scalar and vector
wave equations. The use of potentials for the fields motivates the adoption of
a formulation for particles that is based on a generalized Hamiltonian. A
notable advantage offered by this generalized formulation is the elimination of
time derivatives of the potentials that are required in the standard
Newton-Lorenz treatment of particles. This allows the fields to retain the full
time-accuracy guaranteed by the field solver. The resulting updates for
particles require only knowledge of the fields and their spatial derivatives. A
method for constructing analytical spatial derivatives is presented that
exploits the underlying integral solution used in the field solver for the wave
equations. The field solvers considered in this work belong to a larger class
of methods which are unconditionally stable, can address geometry, and leverage
an $\mathcal\{O\}(N)$ fast summation method for efficiency, known as the Method
of Lines Transpose (MOL$^T$). A time-consistency property of the proposed field
solver for the vector potential form of Maxwell's equations is established,
which ensures that the semi-discrete form of the proposed method satisfies the
semi-discrete Lorenz gauge condition. We demonstrate the method on several
well-established benchmark problems involving plasmas. The efficacy of the
proposed formulation is demonstrated through a comparison with standard methods
presented in the literature, including the popular FDTD method.},

   abstract = {Collisionless magnetic reconnection is studied using a 2 1/2-dimensional hybrid code including Hall dynamics and electron inertia. The simulations reveal that the dissipation region develops a two-scale structure: an inner electron region and an outer ion region. Close to the X line is a region with a scale of the electron collisionless skin depth, where the electron flows completely dominate those of the ions and the frozen-in magnetic flux constraint is broken. Outside of this region and encompassing the rest of the dissipation region, which scales like C/Wpi, the ion inertial length, is the Hall region where the electrons are frozen-in to the magnetic field but the ions are not, allowing the two species to flow at different velocities. The decoupling of electron and ion motion in the dissipation region has important implications for the rate of magnetic reconnection in collisionless plasma: the ions are not constrained to flow through the very narrow region where the frozen-in constraint is broken so that ion flux into the dissipation region is large. For the simulations which have been completed to date, the resulting rate of reconnection is a substantial fraction of the Alfv6n velocity and is controlled by the ions, not the electrons. The dynamics of the ions is found to be inherently nonfluid-like, with multiple ion beams present both at the X line and at the downstream boundary between the inflow and outflow plasma. The reconnection rate is only slightly affected by the temperature of the inflowing ions and in particular the structure of the dissipation region is controlled by the ion inertial length C/Wpi and not the ion Larmor radius based on the incoming ion temperature.},

Here we report the negative J·E′ appearing in the inflow edge of the inner EDR, based on Magnetospheric Multiscale mission observations and particle-in-cell simulations. Both observations and simulations verify that this negative J·E′ is mainly contributed from the electron pressure tensor term in generalized Ohm's law.

Off-equator reconnection exhibits a predominance of events in the Southern Hemisphere during the early nonlinear phase, as observed by satellites at the dayside magnetopause. The late nonlinear phase shows the development of vortex pairing for all latitudes while secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz instability develops only in the Northern Hemisphere, leading to an enhancement of the occurrence of off-equator reconnection there. Since vortices move tailward while evolving, this suggests that reconnection events in the Northern Hemisphere should dominate at the nightside magnetopause.},

This study reproduces the electron-only reconnection during magnetic island coalescence via 2.5-D particle-in-cell simulations. We find that the degree of ion coupling is not sensitive to the spatial scale of the merging current sheet but is determined by the persistent time of the coalescence, which suggests that the electron-only reconnection is the early stage of the coalescence. During the electron-only reconnection, ions are affected by the reconnection electric field though the ion bulk outflow is absent. It is revealed that the pre-existing inflows and Hall electric field Ez from the adjacent main reconnection impede the formation of ion outflow during coalescence. This study provides in-depth knowledge of electron-only reconnection through the perspective of ion kinetics.},

   abstract = {In this letter we attempt to trace back the origin of quantum uncertainty. We show that the Schrödinger equation can be mapped into the inviscid Favre-Reynolds turbulence equations of classical compressible fluids, albeit in zero temperature. Under this mapping the probability density function becomes the Reynolds time mean density of the fluid, the real and the imaginary parts of the momentum become the mean and turbulent root-mean-square velocities, respectively, where the latter obeys the first Fick law of diffusion and saturates the lower bound of the uncertainty principle. The mean pressure is proportional to the divergence of the turbulent mass flux and is the source for stochasticity. The roles of the pressure gradient force and the Reynolds stress tensor convergence, under this mapping, are illustrated in two well-known systems, namely, the 1s orbital hydrogen atom and the 1D dynamic Gaussian wavepacket. Finally, we analyze within an independent part of the letter, a conjecture according to which this pressure results from vacuum fluctuations at the zero-point energy, mediated by random collisions of the particle with virtual photons. This suggests that the typical turbulent eddy is of the size of the Compton wavelength corresponding to a Reynolds averaging time scale which is twice the Zitterbewegung period. Moreover, according to this interpretation the quantized characteristics of the particle result from interactions with virtual photons.},

A dynamical approach, rather than the usual statistical approach, is taken to explore the physical mechanisms underlying the nonlinear transfer of energy, the damping of the turbulent fluctuations, and the development of coherent structures in kinetic plasma turbulence. It is argued that the linear and nonlinear dynamics of Alfvén waves are responsible, at a very fundamental level, for some of the key qualitative features of plasma turbulence that distinguish it from hydrodynamic turbulence, including the anisotropic cascade of energy and the development of current sheets at small scales. The first dynamical model of kinetic turbulence in the weakly collisional solar wind plasma that combines self-consistently the physics of Alfvén waves with the development of small-scale current sheets is presented and its physical implications are discussed. This model leads to a simplified perspective on the nature of turbulence in a weakly collisional plasma: the nonlinear interactions responsible for the turbulent cascade of energy and the formation of current sheets are essentially fluid in nature, while the collisionless damping of the turbulent fluctuations and the energy injection by kinetic instabilities are essentially kinetic in nature.},

   abstract = {High resolution, fully kinetic, three dimensional (3D) simulation of collisionless plasma turbulence shows the development of turbulence characterized by sheetlike current density structures spanning a range of scales. The nonlinear evolution is initialized with a long wavelength isotropic spectrum of fluctuations having polarizations transverse to an imposed mean magnetic field. We present evidence that these current sheet structures are sites for heating and dissipation, and that stronger currents signify higher dissipation rates. The analyses focus on quantities such as J · E, electron, and proton temperatures, and conditional averages of these quantities based on local electric current density. Evidently, kinetic scale plasma, like magnetohydrodynamics, becomes intermittent due to current sheet formation, leading to the expectation that heating and dissipation in astrophysical and space plasmas may be highly nonuniform. Comparison with previous results from 2D kinetic simulations, as well as high frequency solar wind observational data, are discussed. The nature of collisionless dissipation in low density plasmas such as the solar wind and the solar corona has been hotly debated recently, often invoking mechanisms based on various wave modes, such as kinetic Alfvén waves, and whistlers, as well as mechanisms such as linear Vlasov instabilities, cyclotron resonance, and Landau damping [1-5]. Underlying these ideas is a premise that the plasma remains near an equilibrium and therefore that the associated dissipation is described by instabilities and noninteracting waves [2,6-8]. However, solar wind, coro-nal, and magnetospheric observations suggest that an appropriate description may be in terms of a turbulence cascade [1,5,9,10], which may be hydrodynamiclike "strong" turbulence, or "wave" turbulence in which some properties of the linear description persist. Indeed, mag-netohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations reveal that a broad-band cascade to smaller scales invariably occurs, initiated by instability [11], or by direct couplings [12]. If a sufficient spectral range is available, the dynamics can approach a self-similar "inertial range" that is terminated by collisional (viscous, resistive) dissipation at small scales. However, for a collisionless plasma, the dissipation function is unknown, and this, along with other complexities of plasma dynamics, has led to questions regarding the degree to which turbulence theory remains applicable in collison-less plasmas. Progress has been made in revealing the physical processes that terminate the inertial range, and convert cascading energy into heat-issues of fundamental importance in heating of the solar corona and forming the solar wind [9]. However, most of this progress has depended upon the use of reduced dimensionality models, reduced physics models, or very small kinetic scale systems [4,5,13-17]. It is clear that convincing answers to these crucial questions will require complete models, i.e., three space dimensions, three velocity space dimensions, and a full suite of kinetic proton and electron physics. Here we report baseline studies of plasma turbulence properties, for the first time that we are aware, using such a complete 3D kinetic model. An important feature of plasma turbulence found in some reduced kinetic simulations [5,18-20] is that a kinetic cascade produces a hierarchy of electric current structures. Plasma dissipation is found to have a strong quantitative association with these structures. Such reduced dimension-ality, or reduced physics results are instructive, but there is a high priority to extend these results into the much more computationally demanding realm of 3D kinetic simulation , which represents a grand challenge effort (e.g., [21]), and also a necessary step to achieve greater realism. Here we report results from 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations on the study of intermittency, dissipation, and heating in plasma turbulence. Consistent with earlier reduced physics results, this demonstrates that kinetic plasma dissipation in three dimensions is intermittent with dissipation largely occurring in a hierarchy of coherent structures. This lends credence to the idea that heating and dissipation in turbulent space plasmas might also be highly inhomogeneous and patchy as suggested from observations [22-24]. The present simulations employed the simulation code VPIC [25], which solves the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations using the PIC algorithm.},

Although it is well known that magnetic reconnection and turbulence are coupled and transport energy from system-size scales to subproton scales, the details of the energy distribution and energy dissipation channels remain poorly understood. Especially, the energy transfer and transport associated with 3D small-scale reconnection that occurs as a consequence of a turbulent cascade is unknown. We use an explicit fully kinetic particle-in-cell code to simulate 3D small-scale magnetic reconnection events forming in anisotropic and decaying Alfvénic turbulence. We identify a highly dynamic and asymmetric reconnection event that involves two reconnecting flux ropes. We use a two-fluid approach based on the Boltzmann equation to study the spatial energy transfer associated with the reconnection event and compare the power density terms in the two-fluid energy equations with standard energy-based damping, heating, and dissipation proxies. Our findings suggest that the electron bulk flow transports thermal energy density more efficiently than kinetic energy density. Moreover, in our turbulent reconnection event, the energy density transfer is dominated by plasma compression. This is consistent with turbulent current sheets and turbulent reconnection events, but not with laminar reconnection.},

We follow an exact approach pioneered by Onsager, which we explain as a nonperturbative application of the principle of renormalization-group invariance. We obtain results very similar to those for nonrelativistic turbulence, with hydrodynamic fields in the inertial range described as distributional or "coarse-grained" solutions of the relativistic Euler equations. These solutions do not, however, satisfy the naive conservation laws of smooth Euler solutions but are afflicted with dissipative anomalies in the balance equations of internal energy and entropy. The anomalies are shown to be possible by exactly two mechanisms, local cascade and pressure-work defect. We derive "4/5th-law" type expressions for the anomalies, which allow us to characterize the singularities (structure-function scaling exponents) required for their not vanishing. We also investigate the Lorentz covariance of the inertial-range fluxes, which we find to be broken by our coarse-graining regularization but which is restored in the limit where the regularization is removed, similar to relativistic lattice quantum field theory. In the formal limit as speed of light goes to infinity, we recover the results of previous nonrelativistic theory. In particular, anomalous heat input to relativistic internal energy coincides in that limit with anomalous dissipation of nonrelativistic kinetic energy.},

We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations with unprecedentedly large magnetic Reynolds number to reveal how rapid reconnection of magnetic field lines changes the classical paradigm of the turbulent energy cascade. By breaking elongated current sheets into chains of small magnetic flux ropes (or plasmoids), magnetic reconnection leads to a new range of turbulent energy cascade, where the rate of energy transfer is controlled by the growth rate of the plasmoids. As a consequence, the turbulent energy spectra steepen and attain a spectral index of -2.2 that is accompanied by changes in the anisotropy of turbulence eddies. The omnipresence of plasmoids and their consequences on, e.g., solar coronal heating, can be further explored with current and future spacecraft and telescopes.},

   abstract = {We investigate the magnetic energy transfer from the fluid to kinetic scales and dissipation processes using three-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell plasma simulations. The nonlinear evolution of a sheet pinch is studied where we show that it exhibits both fluid scale global relaxation and kinetic scale collisionless reconnection at multiple resonant surfaces. The interactions among collisionless tearing modes destroy the original flux surfaces and produce stochastic fields, along with generating sheets and filaments of intensified currents. In addition, the magnetic energy is transferred from the original shear length scale both to the large scales due to the global relaxation and to the smaller, kinetic scales for dissipation. The dissipation is dominated by the thermal or pressure effect in the generalized Ohm's law, and electrons are preferentially accelerated. Solar coronal and astrophysical plasmas are often tenuous and have a low ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure. The magnetic field energy is usually stored in the twists of magnetic fields, with currents flowing nearly parallel to the background magnetic fields, i.e., an approximately force-free configuration. There is mounting observational evidence that a significant fraction of the available magnetic energy is used to accelerate particles, both in the solar flares and in the lobes of radio galaxies (see, e.g., [1,2]). How the magnetic energy gets transferred from the fluid scale to the kinetic scale for dissipation to accelerate particles, however, remains an important unsolved problem. To date, there are relatively few studies which treat these two scales simultaneously and self-consistently. Collisionless reconnection has been widely regarded as a key mechanism of converting the stored magnetic field energy to heat and energized particles in various environments , such as solar flares, substorms in the Earth's magnetosphere, and disruptions in laboratory fusion experiments [3]. Recent research on reconnection have fo-cused on both the Hall MHD and the collisionless limit (see, e.g., [4] for a review). It has been demonstrated that the collisionless terms in the generalized Ohm's law can facilitate fast reconnection [5-9]. Most these studies, however , have concentrated on the nonlinear dynamics of one current layer that is undergoing reconnection. Some recent 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) studies [10-12] using a force-free sheet-pinch configuration have included the interaction between two unstable current layers. In Ref. [12], the two-layer interaction was found to be the saturation mechanism which reconnected all of the available flux in the system. Furthermore, the critical role of multiple re-connection sites or islands in understanding electron acceleration has also been proposed and studied [13]. These fundamental advances in understanding the detailed particle dynamics in or around a single reconnection site raise the interesting possibility of studying particle energization together with magnetic energy transfer from fluid to kinetic scales. One clear example of such a fluid-kinetic system can be found in laboratory plasma experiments with reversed-field pinch (RFP) configurations. Experimental and nonlinear resistive MHD simulation studies [14] have demonstrated that the RFP is subject to the resistive tearing instability at multiple resonant surfaces. These instabilities break the initially well-organized flux surfaces into chains of magnetic islands which ultimately give rise to stochastic field lines. This MHD behavior consequently exhibits strong effects on particle energization and transport [15]. Another example is the power spectrum of magnetic turbulence in the solar wind where it exhibits a Kolmogorov-like power law spectrum until it reaches approximately the ion cyclotron frequency when a clear steepening of the spectrum occurs. This has been generally interpreted as due to kinetic dissipation in the solar wind [16]. In order to study magnetic energy transport and dissi-pation across different scales self-consistently in one system , we consider a system that contains magnetic ''free'' energy on a relatively large scale initially but releases this free energy through collisionless reconnection at multiple layers. Specifically, we consider a sheet-pinch configuration Bz  B 0 cosz; B 0 sinz; 0 in a region L x ; L y ; L z , where L z  2=, and is the inverse shear length of magnetic fields. It has been shown [12] that there is free energy in this system when the initial magnetic shear length L z is smaller than L x and/or L y. Furthermore , under periodic boundary conditions in all three directions, it has been shown that the collisionless tearing mode (e.g., [17,18]) becomes unstable at the resonant layers, which are defined as k B  0, with k  fk x ; k y g  f2n x =L x ; 2n y =L y g.

   abstract = {Magnetic reconnection is a process that changes magnetic field topology in highly conducting fluids. Within the standard Sweet-Parker model, this process would be too slow to explain observations (e.g. solar flares). In reality, the process must be ubiquitous as astrophysical fluids are magnetized and motions of fluid elements necessarily entail crossing of magnetic frozen-in field lines and magnetic reconnection. In the presence of turbulence, the reconnection is independent of microscopic plasma properties, and may be much faster than previously thought, as proposed in Lazarian & Vishniac (1999) and tested in Kowal et al. (2009, 2012). However, the considered turbulence in the Lazarian-Vishniac model was imposed externally. In this work we consider reconnection-driven magnetized turbulence in realistic three-dimensional geometry initiated by stochastic noise. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that the stochastic reconnection is able to self-generate turbulence through interactions between its outflows. We analyze the statistical properties of velocity fluctuations using power spectra and anisotropy scaling, which demonstrates that the reconnection produces Kolmogorov-like turbulence, compatible with Goldreich-Sridhar (1995) model. Anisotropy statistics are, however, strongly affected by the dynamics of reconnection outflows. Once the broad turbulent region is formed, the typical anisotropy scaling $l_\parallel \propto l_\perp^\{2/3\}$ is formed, especially for high resolution models, were the broader range of scales is available. The decay of reconnection outflows to turbulent-like fluctuations, characterized by different anisotropy scalings, strongly depends on $\beta$ plasma. Moreover, the estimated reconnection rates are weakly dependent on the resolution, suggesting that no external processes are required to make reconnection fast.},

   abstract = {The understanding of the fundamental properties of turbulence in collisionless plasmas, such as the solar wind, is a frontier problem in plasma physics. In particular, the occurrence of magnetic reconnection in turbulent plasmas and its interplay with a fully-developed turbulent state is still a matter of great debate. Here we investigate the properties of small-scale electromagnetic fluctuations and the role of fast magnetic reconnection in the development of a quasi-steady turbulent state by means of 2D-3V high-resolution Vlasov-Maxwell simulations. At the largest scales turbulence is fed by external random forcing. We show that large-scale turbulent motions establish a -5 /3 spectrum at K perp;di <1and, at the same time, feed the formation of current sheets where magnetic reconnection occurs. As a result coherent magnetic structures are generated which, together with the rise of the associated small-scale non-ideal electric field, mediate the transition between the inertial and the subproton-scale spectrum. A mechanism that boosts the magnetic reconnection process is identified, making the generation of coherent structures rapid enough to be competitive with wave mode interactions and leading to the formation of a fully-developed turbulent spectrum across the so-called ion break.},

   abstract = {Description of VPIC VPIC is a 3D relativistic, electromagnetic Particle-In-Cell plasma simulation code. The 3D grid or mesh is a structured Cartesian mesh with uniform grid spacing. Most of the computational work in a time step is done in a series of loops over either particles or grid cells. The average number of particles per cell can range from a few tens to a few thousands depending on the problem being solved. VPIC was designed to use single precision floating point arithmetic to optimize the use of the available memory bandwidth. Both the particle data and the grid data are organized in an array of struct (AoS) storage format that is aligned along the appropriate word boundaries. Data is read and stored using SIMD vector loads and stores and is then transposed on the fly so it can be used in vector operations. VPIC uses asynchronous MPI as the top level of parallelism, Pthreads or OpenMP as the middle level of parallelism and vectorization at the lowest level. The granularity of work assigned to a thread is large. To achieve vectorization, VPIC uses a light weight C++ vector wrapper class that wraps Intel intrinsic function implementations of basic math operations. There is an older 128 bit SSE implementation that uses a vector length of 4, a newer 256 bit AVX2 implementation that uses a vector length of 8 and a still newer 512 bit AVX512 implementation that uses a vector length of 16. There is also a reference implementation that does no explicit vectorization but instead leaves the vectorization task to the compiler. VPIC uses a particle sort as an optimization to enhance cache locality by ordering the particles such that consecutive particles are located in the same cell. The particle sort is performed at a user specified frequency of time steps such that a heavy ion species which is less mobile is sorted less frequently relative to the sort frequency of electrons. VPIC also duplicates the number of copies of the particle accumulator arrays for current density for the multi-thread case to avoid the possibility of multiple threads attempting to update the current density of a cell at the same time. This strategy is reasonable for the case of a small number of threads per MPI rank for particle dominated problems where the number of particles per cell is large i.e. hundreds or thousands of particles per cell. It would not be reasonable for the GPU case where there might be thousands or tens of thousands of threads per MPI rank. For that case, an effective strategy would likely involve use of atomic operations and perhaps involve not sorting the particles or sorting them in a different manner. VPIC has two particle sort implementations, a legacy sort that is MPI parallel but thread serial which allows for either in-place or out-of-place sorts and a thread parallel sort which only supports out-of-place sorts. The particle sort implementation is chosen at compile time. VPIC is written as a mixture of C and C++ code. The most compute intensive kernel in VPIC is the particle loop which gets called by the particle advance function.},

The length scales characterizing the magnetic helicity are found to be equal to or greater than those which characterize the magnetic energy. The magnetic helicity typically lies at scales larger than the magnetic correlation length, consistent with the expectations of the inverse cascade and selective decay hypotheses of three-dimensional MHD turbulence. At smaller scales, the magnetic helicity oscillates in sign. Measurements of the cross helicity are not fully consistent with the usual interpretation in terms of outward propagating Alfvenic functions.

   abstract = {In strongly magnetized astrophysical plasma systems, magnetic reconnection is believed to be the primary process during which explosive energy release and particle acceleration occur, leading to significant high-energy emission. Past years have witnessed active development of kinetic modeling of relativistic magnetic reconnection, supporting this magnetically dominated scenario. A much less explored issue in studies of relativistic reconnection is the consequence of three-dimensional dynamics, where turbulent structures are naturally generated as various types of instabilities develop. This paper presents a series of three-dimensional, fully kinetic simulations of relativistic turbulent magnetic reconnection (RTMR) in positron-electron plasmas with system domains much larger than kinetic scales. Our simulations start from a force-free current sheet with several different modes of long-wavelength magnetic field perturbations, which drive additional turbulence in the reconnection region. Because of this, the current layer breaks up and the reconnection region quickly evolves into a turbulent layer filled with coherent structures such as flux ropes and current sheets. We find that plasma dynamics in RTMR is vastly different from its 2D counterpart in many aspects. The flux ropes evolve rapidly after their generation, and can be completely disrupted by the secondary kink instability. This turbulent evolution leads to superdiffusive behavior of magnetic field lines as seen in MHD studies of turbulent reconnection. Meanwhile, nonthermal particle acceleration and the timescale for energy release can be very fast and do not depend strongly on the turbulence amplitude. The main acceleration mechanism is a Fermi-like acceleration process supported by the motional electric field, whereas the nonideal electric field acceleration plays a subdominant role. We also discuss possible observational implications of three-dimensional RTMR in high-energy astrophysics.},

   abstract = {Abstract Magnetic reconnection converts, often explosively, stored magnetic energy to particle energy in space and in the laboratory. Through processes operating on length scales that are tiny, it facilitates energy conversion over dimensions of, in some cases, hundreds of Earth radii. In addition, it is the mechanism behind large current disruptions in fusion machines, and it can explain eruptive behavior in astrophysics. We have known about the importance of magnetic reconnection for quite some time based on space observations. Theory and modeling employed magnetized fluids, a very simplistic description. While successful at modeling the large-scale consequences of reconnection, it is ill suited to describe the engine itself. This is because, at its heart, magnetic reconnection in space is kinetic, that is, governed by the intricate interaction of charged particles with the electromagnetic fields they create. This complex interaction occurs in very localized regions and involves very short temporal variations. Researching reconnection requires the ability to measure these processes as well as to express them in models vastly more complex than fluid approaches. Until very recently, neither of these capabilities existed. With the advent of NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale mission and modern modeling advances, this has now changed, and we have now determined its small-scale structure in exquisite detail. In this paper, we review recent research results to predict what will be achieved in the future. We discuss how reconnection contributes to the evolution of larger-scale systems, and its societal impacts in the context of threatening space hazards, customarily referred to as ?space weather.?},

   abstract = {Students attending the Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling (CISM) summer school [Simpson, 2004; Gross et al., 2009] not only ask questions of the lecturers but also submit written questions at the end of each lecture sessions. Over the last decade we have collected approximately 3000 of these submitted questions about space weather and associated physical processes. This article addresses questions commonly asked about magnetic reconnection. Some of the questions are about points that are unclear, while others illuminate how students process new or reprocess previous information and sometimes form common misconceptions about reconnection. Some of these issues arise when students apply conceptual plasma approximations (e.g., "frozen-in-flux" or "particles trapped on field lines") and apply them inappropriately. Another source of student misconceptions is the use of the term reconnection by researchers to describe both the process that reconnects the magnetic field at the reconnection point and also the results of field reconfiguration-accelerated and heated plasmas, high-energy particles, and X-rays emissions. Students may also interpret the standard schematic drawing of X-point reconnection literally, believing that reconnection is confined to a plane, and they often misinterpret the relevant length scales. In addition, student questions indicate that they treat field lines, rather than the fields themselves, as physical objects. The questions below are composite questions gleaned from review of the actual questions that students asked during more than a decade of summer schools. Along with identifying the questions, the aim of this article is to document the responses and provide a few useful references for instructors and students. Rather than a scholarly review of the subject, this manuscript provides succinct answers to common questions about magnetic reconnection. What Is Magnetic Reconnection? The CISM summer school curriculum is at the introductory graduate level and assumes that the participants have not had extensive exposure to plasma physics or space physics concepts. Here is a brief working definition of reconnection used in the CISM summer school. In the low-density plasmas found in space, interparticle collisions are so infrequent that to a very good approximation particles remain on (or are essentially "tied to") a magnetic field line. In the fluid description, the conductivity is so large that fluid elements are tied to or "frozen to" the magnetic field; hence, this approximation is referred to as "frozen-in-flux" wherein the magnetic field is frozen to and moves with the fluid. Magnetic reconnection is a process in which the frozen-influx approximation breaks down, which happens when the magnetic field has large gradients over short enough distances for dissipation or kinetic (nonfluid) effects to become important. Then in a small volume called the diffusion region, field lines can "break" and "reconnect" in a new way. This magnetic reconnection process allows these stressed magnetic fields to relax, which releases magnetic energy that can accelerate and heat the plasma and accelerate a van-ishingly small fraction of particles to high energy. On the large scale these stressed fields are usually the result of plasma flows, even though the onset of reconnection itself may not be the caused by a flow. The term magnetic reconnection is used differently in different contexts, which leads to understandable confusion. At its core, magnetic reconnection is the process by which magnetic field lines change their connectivity. This process creates a new magnetic geometry that is often out of equilibrium. As this field reconfigures, it leads to plasma heating and/or acceleration of plasma flows at the expense of magnetic energy as the field relaxes. Some experts use the term "magnetic reconnection" to include the heating and accelerating processes, (e.g., "the flows are accelerated by magnetic reconnection"), whereas the heating and acceleration can be thought of as consequences of the reconnection process itself. The process that allows the field lines to reconnect does not itself cause most of the heating and accelerated flows, though it can accelerate a small fraction of particles. Reconnection in this narrow sense happens in a very small region called the diffusion region because only in this small region is the plasma not tied to the field line, allowing the magnetic field to "diffuse" through the plasma. A negligible fraction, almost none, of the particles or plasma affected by the reconnection enters the diffusion region. Over a much larger region the particles are accelerated (and in the fluid picture the plasma is heated and flows accelerated) by the reconfiguring of the magnetic field that results from the reconnection.},

We find that (a) energy conversion j ⋅ E′ is around zero in quiet current sheet but nonzero in electron-only reconnection, and (b) ion temperature does not change across electron-only reconnection but peaks at the center of standard reconnection. These two differences can be used as criteria to distinguish magnetotail electron-only reconnection from quiet current sheet and standard reconnection, respectively.

We found a clear distinction between stable and unstable cases, dependent on deformation amplitude and ion/electron mass ratio. The threshold appears consistent with electron tearing. The evolution prior to onset, as well as the evolution of stable cases, are largely independent of the mass ratio, governed by integral flux tube entropy conservation as imposed in MHD. This suggests that ballooning instability in the tail should not be expected prior to the onset of tearing and reconnection. The onset time and other onset properties depend on the mass ratio, consistent with expectations for electron tearing. At onset, we found electron anisotropies Tτ/T∥= 1.1-1.3, raising growth rates and wave numbers. Our simulations have provided a quantitative onset criterion that is easily evaluated in MHD simulations, provided the spatial resolution is sufficient. The evolution prior to onset and after the formation of a neutral line does not depend on the electron physics, which should permit an approximation by MHD simulations with appropriate dissipation terms. Key Points Onset conditions for magnetotail tearing are identified Entropy conservation implies stability to ballooning Electron anisotropy raises tearing growth},

Here, we compare and contrast several measures that have been used to characterize energy dissipation and kinetic-scale conversion in plasmas by means of a suite of kinetic numerical simulations describing both magnetic reconnection and decaying plasma turbulence. We adopt three different numerical codes that can also include interparticle collisions: the fully kinetic particle-in-cell VPIC, the fully kinetic continuum Gkeyll, and the Eulerian Hybrid Vlasov–Maxwell (HVM) code. We differentiate between (i) four energy-based parameters, whose definition is related to energy transfer in a fluid description of a plasma, and (ii) four distribution function-based parameters, requiring knowledge of the particle velocity distribution function. There is an overall agreement between the dissipation measures obtained in the PIC and continuum reconnection simulations, with slight differences due to the presence/absence of secondary islands in the two simulations. There are also many qualitative similarities between the signatures in the reconnection simulations and the self-consistent current sheets that form in turbulence, although the latter exhibits significant variations compared to the reconnection results. All the parameters confirm that dissipation occurs close to regions of intense magnetic stresses, thus exhibiting local correlation. The distribution function-based measures show a broader width compared to energy-based proxies, suggesting that energy transfer is co-localized at coherent structures, but can affect the particle distribution function in wider regions. The effect of interparticle collisions on these parameters is finally discussed.},

   abstract = {We have analyzed data from a series of 3D fully kinetic simulations of turbulent magnetic reconnection with a guide field. A new concept of the guide filed reconnection process has recently been proposed, in which the secondary tearing instability and the resulting formation of oblique, small scale flux ropes largely disturb the structure of the primary reconnection layer and lead to 3D turbulent features [W. Daughton et al., Nat. Phys. 7, 539 (2011)]. In this paper, we further investigate the multi-scale physics in this turbulent, guide field reconnection process by introducing a wave number band-pass filter (k-BPF) technique in which modes for the small scale (less than ion scale) fluctuations and the background large scale (more than ion scale) variations are separately reconstructed from the wave number domain to the spatial domain in the inverse Fourier transform process. Combining with the Fourier based analyses in the wave number domain, we successfully identify spatial and temporal development of the multi-scale structures in the turbulent reconnection process. When considering a strong guide field, the small scale tearing mode and the resulting flux ropes develop over a specific range of oblique angles mainly along the edge of the primary ion scale flux ropes and reconnection separatrix. The rapid merging of these small scale modes leads to a smooth energy spectrum connecting ion and electron scales. When the guide field is sufficiently weak, the background current sheet is strongly kinked and oblique angles for the small scale modes are widely scattered at the kinked regions. Similar approaches handling both the wave number and spatial domains will be applicable to the data from multipoint, high-resolution spacecraft observations such as the NASA magnetospheric multiscale (MMS) mission.},

   abstract = {Magnetic reconnection is important to the dynamics of many astrophysical and fusion plasmas but our understanding of it is incomplete. Petaflop-scale simulations of the evolution of turbulent magnetic reconnection in a three-dimensional plasma indicate that it proceeds in a way that is dramatically different from classical theory. Magnetic reconnection releases energy explosively as field lines break and reconnect in plasmas ranging from the Earth’s magnetosphere to solar eruptions and astrophysical applications. Collisionless kinetic simulations have shown that this process involves both ion and electron kinetic-scale features, with electron current layers forming nonlinearly during the onset phase and playing an important role in enabling field lines to break1,2,3,4. In larger two-dimensional studies, these electron current layers become highly extended, which can trigger the formation of secondary magnetic islands5,6,7,8,9,10, but the influence of realistic three-dimensional dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we show that, for the most common type of reconnection layer with a finite guide field, the three-dimensional evolution is dominated by the formation and interaction of helical magnetic structures known as flux ropes. In contrast to previous theories11, the majority of flux ropes are produced by secondary instabilities within the electron layers. New flux ropes spontaneously appear within these layers, leading to a turbulent evolution where electron physics plays a central role.},

We observe the formation of small-scale current-density structures such as current filaments and current sheets as well as the formation of magnetic flux ropes as part of the turbulent cascade. The large magnetic structures present in the simulation domain retain the initial anisotropy while the small-scale structures produced by the turbulent cascade are less anisotropic. To quantify the occurrence of reconnection in our simulation domain, we develop a new set of indicators based on intensity thresholds to identify reconnection events in which both ions and electrons are heated and accelerated in 3-D particle-in-cell simulations. According to the application of these indicators, we identify the occurrence of reconnection events in the simulation domain and analyse one of these events in detail. The event is related to the reconnection of two flux ropes, and the associated ion and electron exhausts exhibit a complex 3-D structure. We study the profiles of plasma and magnetic-field fluctuations recorded along artificial-spacecraft trajectories passing near and through the reconnection region. Our results suggest the presence of particle heating and acceleration related to small-scale reconnection events within magnetic flux ropes produced by the anisotropic Alfvénic turbulent cascade in the solar wind.

   abstract = {We describe a systematic development of kinetic entropy as a diagnostic in fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and use it to interpret plasma physics processes in heliospheric, planetary, and astrophysical systems. First, we calculate kinetic entropy in two forms -- the ``combinatorial'' form related to the logarithm of the number of microstates per macrostate and the ``continuous'' form related to $f \ln f$, where $f$ is the particle distribution function. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each and discuss subtleties about implementing them in PIC codes. Using collisionless PIC simulations that are two-dimensional in position space and three-dimensional in velocity space, we verify the implementation of the kinetic entropy diagnostics and discuss how to optimize numerical parameters to ensure accurate results. We show the total kinetic entropy is conserved to three percent in an optimized simulation of anti-parallel magnetic reconnection. Kinetic entropy can be decomposed into a sum of a position space entropy and a velocity space entropy, and we use this to investigate the nature of kinetic entropy transport during collisionless reconnection. We find the velocity space entropy of both electrons and ions increases in time due to plasma heating during magnetic reconnection, while the position space entropy decreases due to plasma compression. This project uses collisionless simulations, so it cannot address physical dissipation mechanisms; nonetheless, the infrastructure developed here should be useful for studies of collisional or weakly collisional heliospheric, planetary, and astrophysical systems. Beyond reconnection, the diagnostic is expected to be applicable to plasma turbulence and collisionless shocks.},

Although collisions do not significantly influence the statistical characteristics of the turbulence, they strongly suppress the production of non-thermal features in the proton distribution function. The latter consists in a suppression of the enstrophy/entropy cascade in the velocity space, damping the spectral transfer towards large Hermite modes. Moreover, we observe that dissipation is located within regions of strong current activity, confirming that the heating process in turbulent plasmas is spatially inhomogeneous.},

By decomposing the linear Vlasov-Poisson system in the Fourier-Hermite space, the recurrence problem is investigated in the linear regime of the damping of a Langmuir wave and of the onset of the bump-on-tail instability. The analysis is then confirmed and extended to the nonlinear regime through an Eulerian collisional Vlasov-Poisson code. It is found that, despite being routinely used, an artificial collisionality is not a viable way of preventing recurrence in numerical simulations without compromising the kinetic nature of the solution. Moreover, it is shown how numerical effects associated to the generation of fine velocity scales can modify the physical features of the system evolution even in nonlinear regime. This means that filamentation-like phenomena, usually associated with low amplitude fluctuations contexts, can play a role even in nonlinear regime.},

Furthermore, we developed an anisotropic version of CG that allows us to study the magnitude of the cascade rate along different directions with respect to the mean magnetic field. Its implementation on the numerical data with moderate background magnetic field shows a weaker cascade along the magnetic field than in the perpendicular plane, while an isotropic cascade is recovered in the absence of a background field.

   abstract = {An unsolved problem in plasma turbulence is how energy is dissipated at small scales. Particle collisions are too infrequent in hot plasmas to provide the necessary dissipation. Simulations either treat the fluid scales and impose an ad hoc form of dissipation (e.g., resistivity) or consider dissipation arising from resonant damping of small amplitude disturbances where damping rates are found to be comparable to that predicted from linear theory. Here, we report kinetic simulations that span the macroscopic fluid scales down to the motion of electrons. We find that turbulent cascade leads to generation of coherent structures in the form of current sheets that steepen to electron scales, triggering strong localized heating of the plasma. The dominant heating mechanism is due to parallel electric fields associated with the current sheets, leading to anisotropic electron and ion distributions which can be measured with NASA's upcoming Magnetospheric Multiscale mission. The motion of coherent structures also generates waves that are emitted into the ambient plasma in form of highly oblique compressional and shear Alfven modes. In 3D, modes propagating at other angles can also be generated. This indicates that intermittent plasma turbulence will in general consist of both coherent structures and waves. However, the current sheet heating is found to be locally several orders of magnitude more efficient than wave damping and is sufficient to explain the observed heating rates in the solar wind. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {The spectral properties associated with laminar, anti-parallel reconnection are examined using a 2.5D kinetic particle in cell simulation. Both the reconnection rate and the energy spectrum exhibit three distinct phases: an initiation phase where the reconnection rate grows, a quasi-steady phase, and a declining phase where both the reconnection rate and the energy spectrum decrease. During the steady phase, the energy spectrum exhibits approximately a double power law behavior, with a slope near -5/3 at wave numbers smaller than the inverse ion inertial length and a slope steeper than -8/3 for larger wave numbers up to the inverse electron inertial length. This behavior is consistent with a Kolmogorov energy cascade and implies that laminar reconnection may fundamentally be an energy cascade process. Consistent with this idea is the fact that the reconnection rate exhibits a rough correlation with the energy spectrum at wave numbers near the inverse ion inertial length. The 2D spectrum is strongly anisotropic with most energy associated with the wave vector direction normal to the current sheet. Reconnection acts to isotropize the energy spectrum, reducing the Shebalin angle from an initial value of 70° to about 48° (nearly isotropic) by the end of the simulation. The distribution of energy over length scales is further analyzed by dividing the domain into spatial subregions and employing structure functions.},

We describe an algorithm that identifies current sheets in a simulation snapshot and then determines their geometrical properties (including length, width, and thickness) and intensities (peak current density and total energy dissipation rate). We then apply this procedure to simulations of reduced MHD and perform a statistical analysis on the obtained population of current sheets. We evaluate the role of reconnection by separately studying the populations of current sheets which contain magnetic X-points and those which do not.

We find that the current density layers may undergo the plasmoid or the KH instability depending on the local values of the magnetic and velocity fields.

Evolution equations for the entropy are derived and they reveal mechanisms that lead to changes in fluid entropy. These equations are verified by a collisionless particle-in-cell simulation of multiple reconnecting current sheets.

Alfvén mode properties at maximum dissipation are independent of Te/Tp, and the corresponding magnetosonic mode properties are weakly dependent on this temperature ratio, so theory predicts that the proton beta βp is the primary parameter determining kd. Theory yields kdc/ωp = Sk/βpαk, where ωp is the proton plasma frequency and Sk and αk are fitting parameters; for the Alfvén mode αk ≃ 0.3, whereas for the magnetosonic mode αk ≃ 0.8.

When close to equi-partition between kinetic and magnetic energy, the scaling relations involve only structure functions in a manner similar to the '' 4 5 law'' of Kolmogorov. S1063-651X9850601-0 PACS numbers: 47.27.Jv, 47.27.Gs, 47.65.a Magnetized flows are common in the universe, and are often in a turbulent state; examples are that of the solar co-rona, where magnetohydrodynamics MHD turbulence is likely at the origin of the power-law distributions of the lu-minosity of flares 1, or the interstellar medium where turbulence plays an essential role to sustain dense cold clouds 2; in the solar wind, several in situ measurements e.g., from the spacecrafts Helios, Voyager, and now Ulysses provide information on structure functions of the velocity and magnetic fields indicating that the fields are strongly intermittent 3; finally, the ground-based instrument Themis, soon operational, will provide similar information for the small magnetic structures of the solar photosphere. In view of these various domains of application, a theoretical basis equivalent to the rigorous results of von Ká rmá n and Howarth 4, and of Kolmogorov 5 for incompressible non-helical flows-concerning the temporal evolution of the longitudinal second-order energy tensor in terms of the third-order one, and the scaling of the latter in the inertial range-but for magnetized flows is in demand. The technically helpful restriction to incompressible nonhelical flows is un-realistic although often used as far as the above-mentioned astrophysical and geophysical flows are concerned 6. Nevertheless , this work represents a first step in providing theoretical constraints on the dynamical evolution of small-scale structures in MHD. These structures magnetic flux tubes and vortex and current sheets have been studied analytically e.g., in the context of reconnection, mostly in the linear regime, and have also been investigated numerically mostly in the incompressible case e.g., 7 in two space dimensions, and in three dimensions 8. In 1941, Kolmogorov wrote three oft-quoted papers 5,9 concerning homogeneous isotropic incompressible fluid turbulence viz. a the distribution of kinetic energy among Fourier modes E V (k)(¯) 2/3 k 5/3 , where ¯ is the kinetic energy flux to small scale and decay rate E ˙ V ; b the temporal decay of the kinetic energy E V (t)(tt *) 10/7 where t * is typically the time at which the enstrophy 2 reaches its first maximum, with "v the vorticity and v the velocity; and c the scaling law for the longitudinal third-order structure function S 3 (r) 4 5 ¯ r, where S 3 (r) v L 3 (r) with v L (r)v(xr)v(x)•r, r being the displacement vector and rr; hereafter, the subscript L denotes longitudinal components. Whereas the first two laws stem from phenomenological considerations, the third one is deduced rigorously from the Navier-Stokes equations, in the inertial range neglecting viscosity. Extensions of the so-called '' 4 5 '' law of Kolmogorov to the case of a scalar passively advected 10, such as the temperature or a pollutant in the atmosphere, as well as to the case of a scalar with a dynamical effect on the velocity, such as the magnetic potential in two-dimensional MHD 11, show that it is the correlation between the scalar and the velocity field that is constrained by the invariance properties of the equations, thereby indicating the necessity not to neglect such correlations in modeling turbulent flows, since they are essential for nonzero turbulent transfer. We write for an incompressible conducting flow t z •"z "P * 2 z 2 z 1 for the Elsä sser fields z vb, where b is the magnetic induction, P * Pb 2 /2 the total pressure, ()/2, where is the viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity, and "•v0, "•b0; a force term can be added as well. In conducting flows, the nonlinear interactions and thus the ensuing phenomenology describing such interactions are more complex than for neutral fluids. The standard model of Iroshnikov and Kraichnan 12 leads to E T (k) (T B 0) 1/2 k 3/2 for the energy Fourier spectrum and, in three dimensions in the simplest case, a decay of energy that is substantially slower than for neutral fluids with E T (t) (tt *) 5/6 13, where B 0 is a large-scale magnetic field, E T is the total kinetic plus magnetic energy, and T E ˙ T is its flux. The phenomenological modeling of Ref. 12 relies on taking into account the slowing down of the energy transfer due to the interaction of z eddies propagating in opposite directions along B 0. The Kolmogorov law 5 arises from the conservation of energy in the limit of negligible dissipation, i.e., in the iner-tial range and then taking the limit r→0, otherwise S 3 (r) r 3 trivially from a Taylor expansion; the 4 5 law follows from the von Ká rmá n-Howarth equation, which we first generalize to MHD using the fact that the invariants in terms of the Elsä sser fields are E z 2 /2.

In its application to such hydro-dynamical problems, the theory falls into two parts, a kinematical part and a dynamical part. The kinematical aspect consists in setting up correlations between velocity components, or their derivatives, at two arbitrary points in the fluid, and reducing the form of the tensor thus obtained in accordance with the severely restrictive assumption of isotropic turbulence; the success of de Kármán and Howarth's investigations is largely attributable to their improved treatment of this purely kinematical problem. The dynamical part then consists in applying the implications of the equations of continuity and motion to the functions defining the correlation tensors, in order to obtain information concerning their functional dependence on time and on the displacement between the two points for which the correlations are computed.},

   abstract = {Context. The observation of numerous magnetic switchbacks and associated plasma jets in Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during its first five orbits, particularly near the Sun, has attracted considerable attention. Switchbacks have been found to be systematically associated with correlated reversals in the direction of the propagation of Alfvénic fluctuations, as well as similar reversals of the electron strahl. Aims. Here we aim to see whether the energetic particles change direction at the magnetic field switchbacks. Methods. We use magnetic field data from the MAG suite's fluxgate magnetometer instrument to identify switchback regions. We examine the radial anisotropy of the energetic particles measured by the EPI-Lo instrument of the ISIS suite. Results. We find that energetic particles measured by EPI-Lo generally do not preferentially change their directionality from that of the background magnetic field to that of the switchbacks. Conclusions. A reasonable hypothesis is that particles with smaller gyroradii, such as strahl electrons, can reverse direction by following the magnetic field in switchbacks, but that larger gyroradii particles cannot. This provides the possibility of setting a constraint on the radius of the curvature of the magnetic field in switchbacks, a property not otherwise observed by PSP. We expect that particles at higher energies than those detectable by EPI-Lo will also not respond to switchbacks. The observed reversals of radial energetic particle flux are separate phenomena, likely associated with source locations or other propagation effects occurring at greater radial distances.},

   abstract = { Motivated by prior remote observations of a transition from striated solar coronal structures to more isotropic “flocculated” fluctuations, we propose that the dynamics of the inner solar wind just outside the Alfvén critical zone, and in the vicinity of the first       surface, is powered by the relative velocities of adjacent coronal magnetic flux tubes. We suggest that large-amplitude flow contrasts are magnetically constrained at lower altitude but shear-driven dynamics are triggered as such constraints are released above the Alfvén critical zone, as suggested by global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations that include self-consistent turbulence transport. We argue that this dynamical evolution accounts for features observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) near initial perihelia, including magnetic “switchbacks,” and large transverse velocities that are partially corotational and saturate near the local Alfvén speed. Large-scale magnetic increments are more longitudinal than latitudinal, a state unlikely to originate in or below the lower corona. We attribute this to preferentially longitudinal velocity shear from varying degrees of corotation. Supporting evidence includes comparison with a high Mach number three-dimensional compressible MHD simulation of nonlinear shear-driven turbulence, reproducing several observed diagnostics, including characteristic distributions of fluctuations that are qualitatively similar to PSP observations near the first perihelion. The concurrence of evidence from remote sensing observations, in situ measurements, and both global and local simulations supports the idea that the dynamics just above the Alfvén critical zone boost low-frequency plasma turbulence to the level routinely observed throughout the explored solar system. },

These observational results are supported by solving coupled solar wind and turbulence transport equations including a KH-driven source of turbulence along the tangential velocity discontinuity between faster and slower coronal flows: numerical analysis indicates that the correlation between the solar wind speed and temperature is large in the presence of the shear source of turbulence. These findings suggest that the KH instability may play an important role both in the plasma dynamics and in the energy deposition at the boundaries of coronal holes and equatorial streamers.},

Here, we provide a complementary assessment of their role in the turbulent cascade. The validation of the third-order linear scaling of velocity and magnetic fluctuations in intervals characterized by a high occurrence of switchbacks suggests that, irrespective of their local or remote origin, these structures are actively embedded in the turbulent cascade, at least at the radial distances sampled by PSP during its first perihelion.

[S0031-9007(99)08959-0] PACS numbers: 96.50.Ci, 52.30.-q, 52.35.Ra Low-frequency fluctuations in the solar wind plasma represent perhaps the most extensively studied type of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, having been observed by spacecraft instruments for more than thirty years [1-3]. The observed turbulence displays properties expected of both hydrodynamic and MHD theories, including distinctive spectra and correlations [3,4]. Solar wind turbulence is a crucial element in coupling the lower corona plasma and the earth's magnetosphere, and in the transport of energetic charged particles throughout the solar-terrestrial environment. It is also a prototype for understanding stellar and galactic winds and astrophysical plasma flows in general. There has been notable progress in understanding the cascade process [5-12] that accompanies solar wind turbulence. So far, however, no single quantitative model has explained how turbulent energy flows from the largest interacting structures to the smallest dissipative scales where it is deposited as heat. In this Letter we present such a theory, based upon the dynamics of large-scale "eddies," which, controlled by a single similarity scale, drives a cascade that supplies thermal energy to the fluid plasma. The theoretical results compare well with measurements by the Voyager 2 spacecraft at heliocentric radial distances r from 1 astronomical units (AU) to beyond 30 AU. This motivates the development of similar phenomenological turbulence theories for nonlinear MHD flows in a variety of astrophysical plasmas. From the Helios and Mariner missions reaching inside 0.3 AU, to the Voyager and Pioneer explorations beyond 50 AU, spacecraft instruments have returned magnetic field data and plasma data (proton temperature, velocity, and density) that reveal the organized large-scale structure of the heliospheric plasma, along with transient mesoscale features such as coronal mass ejections and an ubiquitous but nonuniform admixture of fluctuations. Substantial fluctuation energy resides in an inferred range of spatial scales between the ion inertial scale (10 6 cm at 1 AU) and the observed correlation scale l (6 3 10 11 cm at 1 AU). The radial dependence of fluctuations in the low latitude solar wind is illustrated using Voyager 2 data in Figs. 1-3, which portray magnetic field variance (energy density in the turbulent magnetic field), correlation length, and proton temperature, from 1 AU to beyond 30 AU. To simultaneously explain these three data sets is a significant challenge. The main objective of this Letter is to provide such an explanation based upon turbulence theory. Observed properties of solar wind MHD fluctuations are interpreted in two distinct ways. A distinctive velocity-magnetic field correlation is observed frequently and is suggestive of large amplitude noninteracting Alfvén waves [3]. Conversely, the wave number k spectrum of fluctuations , having typically a k 253 Kolmogorov form, indicates quasisteady spectral transfer and strong nonlinear couplings. This dichotomy persists when noting that the radial variation of the fluctuation energy from 1-10 AU follows the WKB r 23 scaling rather closely (Fig. 1), suggesting again noninteracting waves [13]. However, the radial evolution of the correlation scale is inconsistent with a WKB expansion (Fig. 2). A purely wave picture also FIG. 1.

   abstract = {A general stability analysis is performed for the Kelvin‐Helmholtz instability in sheared magnetohydrodynamic flow of finite thickness in a compressible plasma. The analysis allows for arbitrary orientation of the magnetic field B 0, velocity flow v 0, and wave vector k in the plane perpendicular to the velocity gradient, and no restrictions are imposed on the sound or Alfvén Mach numbers. The stability problem is reduced to the solution of a single second‐order differential equation, which includes a gravitational term to represent coupling between the Kelvin‐Helmholtz mode and the interchange mode. In the incompressible limit it is shown that the Kelvin‐Helmholtz mode is completely stabilized for any velocity profile as long as the condition V0<2υA(kˆ·Bˆ0)/(kˆ·υˆ0) is satisfied, where V 0 is the total velocity jump across the shear layer. Numerical results are obtained for a hyperbolic tangent velocity profile for the transverse (B 0 ⊥ v 0) and parallel (B 0∥v 0) flow configurations. Only modes with kΔ < 2 are unstable, where Δ is the scale length of the shear layer. The fastest growing modes occur for kΔ ∼ 0.5‐1.0. Compressibility and a magnetic field component parallel to the flow are found to be stabilizing effects. For the transverse case, only the fast magnetosonic mode is destabilized, but if k · B 0 ≠ 0, the instability contains Alfvén‐mode and slow‐mode components as well. The Alfvén component gives rise to a field‐aligned current inside the shear layer. In the parallel case, both Alfvén and slow magnetosonic components are present, with the Alfvén mode confined inside the shear layer. The results of the analysis are used to discuss the stability of sheared plasma flow at the magnetopause boundary and in the solar wind. At the magnetopause boundary, the fastest growing Kelvin‐Helmholtz mode has a frequency of 0 (V 0/2Δ), which overlaps with the frequency range of geomagnetic pulsations (Pc 3‐5). It is suggested that the MHD Kelvin‐Helmholtz instability could serve as a dynamo process driving small‐scale field‐aligned currents in the presence of the sheared plasma flow in the magnetosphere.},

   abstract = {Local inversions are often observed in the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF), but their origins and evolution are not yet fully understood. Parker Solar Probe has recently observed rapid, Alfvénic, HMF inversions in the inner heliosphere, known as ‘switchbacks’, which have been interpreted as the possible remnants of coronal jets. It has also been suggested that inverted HMF may be produced by near-Sun interchange reconnection; a key process in mechanisms proposed for slow solar wind release. These cases suggest that the source of inverted HMF is near the Sun, and it follows that these inversions would gradually decay and straighten as they propagate out through the heliosphere. Alternatively, HMF inversions could form during solar wind transit, through phenomena such velocity shears, draping over ejecta, or waves and turbulence. Such processes are expected to lead to a qualitatively radial evolution of inverted HMF structures. Using Helios measurements spanning 0.3–1 au, we examine the occurrence rate of inverted HMF, as well as other magnetic field morphologies, as a function of radial distance r, and find that it continually increases. This trend may be explained by inverted HMF observed between 0.3 and 1 au being primarily driven by one or more of the above in-transit processes, rather than created at the Sun. We make suggestions as to the relative importance of these different processes based on the evolution of the magnetic field properties associated with inverted HMF. We also explore alternative explanations outside of our suggested driving processes which may lead to the observed trend.},

   abstract = {Over three decades of in-situ observations illustrate that the Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instability driven by the sheared flow between the magnetosheath and magnetospheric plasma often occurs on the magnetopause of Earth and other planets under various interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. It has been well demonstrated that the KH instability plays an important role for energy, momentum, and mass transport during the solar-wind-magnetosphere coupling process. Particularly, the KH instability is an important mechanism to trigger secondary small scale (i.e., often kinetic-scale) physical processes, such as magnetic reconnection, kinetic Alfvén waves, ion-acoustic waves, and turbulence, providing the bridge for the coupling of cross scale physical processes. From the simulation perspective, to fully investigate the role of the KH instability on the cross-scale process requires a numerical modeling that can describe the physical scales from a few Earth radii to a few ion (even electron) inertial lengths in three dimensions, which is often computationally expensive. Thus, different simulation methods are required to explore physical processes on different length scales, and cross validate the physical processes which occur on the overlapping length scales. Test particle simulation provides such a bridge to connect the MHD scale to the kinetic scale. This study applies different test particle approaches and cross validates the different results against one another to investigate the behavior of different ion species (i.e., H+ and O+), which include particle distributions, mixing and heating. It shows that the ion transport rate is about 1025 particles/s, and mixing diffusion coefficient is about 1010 m2 s−1 regardless of the ion species. Magnetic field lines change their topology via the magnetic reconnection process driven by the three-dimensional KH instability, connecting two flux tubes with different temperature, which eventually causes anisotropic temperature in the newly reconnected flux.},

This can give rise to magnetic separatrices and neutral lines. MHD fluctuations generated at the base of the coronal hole by motions of the inner layer of the solar atmosphere may interact with such inhomogeneities, leading to the formation of small scales. This phenomenon is studied on a 2D model of a magnetic structure with an X-point, using 2D MHD numerical simulations. This model implements a method of characteristics for boundary conditions in the direction outer-pointing to Sun surface to simulate both wave injection and exit without reflection. Both Alfvénic and magnetosonic perturbations are considered, and they show very different phenomenology. In the former case, an anisotropic power-law spectrum forms with a dominance of perpendicular wavevectors at altitudes ∼104 km. Density fluctuations are generated near the X-point by Alfvén wave magnetic pressure and propagate along open fieldlines at a speed comparable to the local Alfvén velocity. An analysis of energy dissipation and heating caused by the formation of small scales for the Alfvénic case is presented. In the magnetosonic case, small scales form only around the X-point, where a phenomenon of oscillating magnetic reconnection is observed to be induced by the periodic deformation of the magnetic structure due to incoming waves.},

   abstract = {Since its launch in 2018, the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission revealed the presence of numerous fascinating phenomena occurring closer to the Sun, such as the presence of ubiquitous switchbacks (SBs). The SBs are large magnetic field deflections of the local magnetic field relative to a background field. We investigated the statistical properties of the SBs during the first 10 encounters between 13.28 and 58 solar radii (R e) using data from the SWEAP and FIELDS suites on board PSP. We find that the occurrence percentage of small deflections with respect to the Parker spiral decreases with radial distance (R). In contrast, the occurrence percentage of the large deflections (SBs) increases with R, as does the SB patches. We also find that the occurrence of SBs correlates with the bulk velocity of the solar wind, i.e., the higher the solar wind velocity, the higher the SB occurrence. For V sw  400 km s −1 , the SB occurrence percentage shows a constantly increasing trend between 13 and 58 R e. However, for V sw > 400 km s −1 , the occurrence percentage saturates beyond 35 R e. The occurrence percentage of mini SB patches (<60 s) shows a decreasing trend with R, while the occurrence percentage of long-duration SB patches (>200 s) increases with R. Sub-Alfvénic regions that we analyzed during Encounters 8-10 have not shown any SBs. This analysis of the PSP data hints that some of the SBs are decaying and some are being created in situ.

In contrast, the near-Earth solar wind is strongly super-Alfvénic, i.e., the wind speed greatly exceeds the Alfvén speed. The transition between these regimes is classically described as the “Alfvén point” but may in fact occur in a distributed Alfvén critical region. NASA’s Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission has entered this region, as it follows a series of orbits that gradually approach more closely to the Sun. During its 8 th and 9 th solar encounters, at a distance of ≈16 R ⊙ from the Sun, PSP sampled four extended periods in which the solar wind speed was measured to be smaller than the local Alfvén speed. These are the first in situ detections of sub-Alfvénic solar wind in the inner heliosphere by PSP. Here we explore properties of these samples of sub-Alfvénic solar wind, which may provide important previews of the physical processes operating at lower altitude. Specifically, we characterize the turbulence, anisotropy, intermittency, and directional switchback properties of these sub-Alfvénic winds and contrast these with the neighboring super-Alfvénic periods. },

Recent spacecraft observations in the inner heliosphere have revealed the presence of local Alfvenic reversals of the magnetic field, while the field magnitude remains almost constant. They are called magnetic switchbacks and are very common in the plasma environment close to the Sun explored by the Parker Solar Probe satellite. Aims. A simple numerical model of a magnetic field reversal with constant magnitude is used in order to explore the influence of switchbacks on the propagation of energetic particles, within a range of energy typical of solar energetic particles. Methods. We model the reversal as a region of space of adjustable size bounded by two rotational discontinuities. By means of test particle simulations, beams of mono-energetic particles can be injected upstream of the switchback with various initial pitch- and gyro-phase angles. In each simulation, the particle energy may also be changed. Results. Particle dynamics is highly affected by the ratio between the particle gyroradius and the size of the switchback, with multiple pitch-angle scatterings when the particle gyroradius is of the order of the switchback size. Further, particle motion is extremely sensitive to the initial conditions implying a transition to chaos; for some parameters of the system, a large share of particles is reflected backwards upstream as they interact with the switchback. These results can have a profound impact on the solar energetic particle transport in the inner heliosphere, thus possible comparisons with in-situ spacecraft data are discussed.},

   abstract = {The solar wind shows periods of highly Alfv\'enic activity, where velocity fluctuations and magnetic fluctuations are aligned or anti-aligned with each other. It is generally agreed that solar wind plasma velocity and magnetic field fluctuations observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during the first encounter are mostly highly Alfv\'enic. However, quantitative measures of Alfv\'enicity are needed to understand how the characterization of these fluctuations compares with standard measures from prior missions in the inner and outer heliosphere, in fast wind and slow wind, and at high and low latitudes. To investigate this issue, we employ several measures to quantify the extent of Alfv\'enicity -- the Alfv\'en ratio $r_A$, \{normalized\} cross helicity $\sigma_c$, \{normalized\} residual energy $\sigma_r$, and the cosine of angle between velocity and magnetic fluctuations $\cos\theta_\{vb\}$. We show that despite the overall impression that the Alfv\'enicity is large in the solar wind sampled by PSP during the first encounter, during some intervals the cross helicity starts decreasing at very large scales. These length-scales (often $> 1000 d_i$) are well inside inertial range, and therefore, the suppression of cross helicity at these scales cannot be attributed to kinetic physics. This drop at large scales could potentially be explained by large-scale shears present in the inner heliosphere sampled by PSP. In some cases, despite the cross helicity being constant down to the noise floor, the residual energy decreases with scale in the inertial range. These results suggest that it is important to consider all these measures to quantify Alfv\'enicity.},

We find that large-scale shear can nonlinearly produce a cascade to smaller scale fluctuations even when the linear Kelvin-Helmholtz mode is stable and that a roughly power law inertial range is established by this process. While the fluctuations thus produced are not Alfvénic, they are nearly equipartitioned between magnetic and kinetic energy. We report simulations with Alfvénic fluctuations at high wave numbers, both with and without shear layers and find that it is the low cross helicity at low wave numbers that is critical to the cross helicity evolution, rather than the geometry of the flow or the dominance of kinetic energy at large scales. The fluctuations produced by shear effects are shown to evolve similarly but more slowly in the presence of a larger mean field and to be anisotropic with a preferred direction of spectral transfer perpendicular to the mean field. The evolution found is similar to that seen in some other simulations of MHD turbulence, and thus seems in many respects to be a instance of a more generic turbulent evolution rather than due to specific conditions in the solar wind.},

VPIC simulations of laser plasma interaction were conducted at unprecedented fidelity and scale- up to 1.0 × 1012 particles on as many as 136 × 106 voxels- to model accurately the particle trapping physics occurring within a laser-driven hohlraum in an inertial confinement fusion experiment. During a parameter study of laser reflectivity as a function of laser intensity under experimentally realizable hohlraum conditions [1], we measured sustained performance exceeding 0.374 Pflop/s (s.p.) with the inner loop itself achieving 0.488 Pflop/s (s.p.). Given the increasing importance of data motion limitations, it is notable that this was measured in a PIC calculation-a technique that typically requires more data motion per computation than other techniques (such as dense matrix calculations, molecular dynamics N-body calculations and Monte- Carlo calculations) often used to demonstrate supercomputer performance. This capability opens up the exciting possibility of using VPIC to model, from first-principles, an issue critical to the success of the multi-billion dollar DOE/NNSA National Ignition Facility. © 2008 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of decaying high-Reynolds-number turbulence are presented at resolutions up to 800 for general periodic flows and 2048 for periodic flows with large-scale symmetries. For turbulence initially excited at large scales, we characterize a transition of the inertial energy-spectrum exponent from n ≈— 4 at early times to n ≈ — 3 when the turbulence becomes more mature. In physical space, the first regime is associated with isolated vorticity-gradient sheets, as predicted by Saffman (1971). The second regime, which is essentially statistical, corresponds to an enstrophy cascade (Kraichnan 1967; Batchelor 1969) and reflects the formation of layers resulting from the packing of vorticity-gradient sheets. In addition to these small-scale structures, the simulation displays vorticity macro-eddies which will survive long after the vorticity-gradient layers have been dissipated (McWilliams 1984). We validate the linear description of two-dimensional turbulence suggested by Weiss (1981), which predicts that coherent vortices will survive in regions where vorticity dominates strain, while vorticity-gradient sheets will be formed in regions where strain dominates. We show that this analysis remains valid even after vorticity-gradient sheets have been formed. © 1988, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

In collisionless magnetic reconnection, the reconnection site is usually unsteady and ejects reconnection fronts away from it. Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we study the energy budgets from the collisionless magnetic reconnection site to reconnection fronts. It is concluded that the reconnection rate cannot well reflect energy conversion of nonsteady state magnetic reconnection because energy conversion occurs predominantly at the reconnection fronts, whereas the reconnection rate can only represent the energy conversion at the reconnection site. We clarify the connection between the reconnection site and the reconnection fronts in terms of energy conversion. The reconnection site functions as a trigger and energy source that generates the outflow of Poynting flux, bulk kinetic energy flux, and enthalpy flux forming the reconnection fronts that move downstream. The well-developed reconnection fronts are no longer related to the reconnection site. The energy income at the reconnection fronts is mainly the Poynting flux from their top and bottom boundaries, most of which is transformed to (Formula presented.) flux flowing downstream out of the moving front through the work by the electric field. The work done by the electric force is compensated with the work done by the thermal pressure gradient, which guarantees that the released magnetic energy is mostly converted to thermal energy.},

   abstract = {Intermittent turbulence is key for understanding the stochastic nonlinear dynamics of space, astrophysical, and laboratory plasmas. We review the theory of deterministic and stochastic temporal chaos in plasmas and discuss its link to intermittent turbulence observed in space plasmas. First, we discuss the theory of chaos, intermittency, and complexity for nonlinear Alfvén waves, and parametric decay and modulational wave–wave interactions, in the absence/presence of noise. The transition from order to chaos is studied using the bifurcation diagram. The following two types of deterministic intermittent chaos in plasmas are considered: type-I Pomeau–Manneville intermittency and crisis-induced intermittency. The role of structures known as chaotic saddles in deterministic and stochastic chaos in plasmas is investigated. Alfvén complexity associated with noise-induced intermittency, in the presence of multistability, is studied. Next, we present evidence of magnetic reconnection and intermittent magnetic turbulence in coronal mass ejections in the solar corona and solar wind via remote and in situ observations. The signatures of turbulent magnetic reconnection, i.e., bifurcated current sheet, reconnecting jet, parallel/anti-parallel Alfvénic waves, and spiky dynamical pressure pulse, as well as fully developed turbulence, are detected at the leading edge of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection and the interface region of two merging interplanetary magnetic flux ropes. Methods for quantifying the degree of coherence, amplitude–phase synchronization, and multifractality of nonlinear multiscale fluctuations are discussed. The stochastic chaotic nature of Alfvénic intermittent structures driven by magnetic reconnection is determined by a complexity–entropy analysis. Finally, we discuss the relation of nonlinear dynamics and intermittent turbulence in space plasmas to similar phenomena observed in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas, e.g., coronal mass ejections and flares in the stellar-exoplanetary environment and Galactic Center, as well as chaos, magnetic reconnection, and intermittent turbulence in laser-plasma and nuclear fusion experiments.},

Energy transfer in the parallel direction and the energy levels in the parallel components are both relatively weak. In the dissipation range, observations indicate that variance anisotropy tends to decrease towards isotropic levels as the electron gyroradius is approached; spectral anisotropy results are mixed.

In order to explain coronal and interplanetary heating, the micro-physics of the dissipation of various forms of mechanical, electric and magnetic energy at small scales (e.g., contained in plasma waves, turbulences or non-uniform flows) must be addressed. We therefore scrutinise the basic assumptions underlying the classical transport theory and the related collisional heating rates, and also describe alternatives associated with wave-particle interactions. We elucidate the kinetic aspects of heating the solar corona and interplanetary plasma through Landau-and cyclotron-resonant damping of plasma waves, and analyse in detail wave absorption and micro instabilities. Important aspects (virtues and limitations) of fluid models, either single-and multi-species or magnetohydrodynamic and multi-moment models, for coronal heating and solar wind acceleration are critically discussed.

As a matter of fact, Helios inner heliosphere and Ulysses' high latitude observations, recent multi-spacecrafts measurements in the solar wind (Cluster four satellites) and new numerical approaches to the problem, based on the dynamics of complex systems, brought new important insights which helped to better understand how turbulent fluctuations behave in the solar wind. In particular, numerical simulations within the realm of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence theory unraveled what kind of physical mechanisms are at the basis of turbulence generation and energy transfer across the spectral domain of the fluctuations. In other words, the advances reached in these past years in the investigation of solar wind turbulence now offer a rather complete picture of the phenomenological aspect of the problem to be tentatively presented in a rather organic way.},

   abstract = {We investigate through high-resolution three-dimensional simulations the nonlinear evolution of com-pressible magnetohydrodynamic Ñows subject to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. As in our earlier work, we have considered periodic sections of Ñows that contain a thin, transonic shear layer but are otherwise uniform. The initially uniform magnetic Ðeld is parallel to the shear plane but oblique to the Ñow itself. We conÐrm in three-dimensional Ñows the conclusion from our two-dimensional work that even apparently weak magnetic Ðelds embedded in Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable plasma Ñows can be fundamentally important to nonlinear evolution of the instability. In fact, that statement is strengthened in three dimensions by this work because it shows how Ðeld-line bundles can be stretched and twisted in three dimensions as the quasiÈtwo-dimensional CatÏs Eye vortex forms out of the hydrodynamical motions. In our simulations twisting of the Ðeld may increase the maximum Ðeld strength by more than a factor of 2 over the two-dimensional e †ect. If, by these developments, the Mach number of Alfve n Ñows around the CatÏs Eye drops to unity or less, our simulations suggest that magnetic stresses will eventually destroy the CatÏs Eye and cause the plasma Ñow to self-organize into a relatively smooth and apparently stable Ñow that retains memory of the original shear. For our Ñow conÐgurations, the regime in three dimensions for such reorganization is expressed in terms of the Mach 4 [ M Ax [ 50, Alfve n number of the original velocity transition and the initial speed projected to the Ñow plan. When Alfve n the initial Ðeld is stronger than this, the Ñow either is linearly stable (if or becomes stabilized M Ax [ 2) by enhanced magnetic tension as a result of the corrugated Ðeld along the shear layer before the CatÏs Eye forms (if For weaker Ðelds the instability remains essentially hydrodynamic in early M Ax Z 2). stages, and the CatÏs Eye is destroyed by the hydrodynamic secondary instabilities of a three-dimensional nature. Then, the Ñows evolve into chaotic structures that approach decaying isotropic turbulence. In this stage, there is considerable enhancement to the magnetic energy due to stretching, twisting, and turbulent ampliÐcation, which is retained long afterward. The magnetic energy eventually catches up to the kinetic energy, and the nature of Ñows becomes magnetohydrodynamic. Decay of the magnetohydro-dynamic turbulence is enhanced by dissipation accompanying magnetic reconnection. Hence, in three dimensions as in two dimensions, very weak Ðelds do not modify substantially the character of the Ñow evolution but do increase global dissipation rates.

The expectation based on similar hydrodynamics scalings, is that the kurtosis, of the small scale magnetic field increments, will increase with increasing Reynolds number. Simple theoretical arguments as well as Voyager observations indicate that effective interplanetary turbulence Reynolds number decreases with increasing heliocentric distance. The decrease of scale-dependent magnetic increment kurtosis with increasing heliocentric distance, is verified using a newly refined Voyager magnetic field dataset. We argue that these scalings continue to much smaller heliocentric distances approaching the Alfven critical region, motivating a prediction that the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft will observe increased magnetic field intermittency, stronger current sheets, and more localized dissipation, as its perihelion approaches the critical regions.

   abstract = {The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) is a standard test of hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation codes and finds many applications in astrophysics. The classic linear theory considers a discontinuity in density and velocity at the interface of two fluids. However, for numerical simulations of the KHI such initial conditions do not yield converged results even at the linear stage of the instability. Instead, smooth profiles of velocity and density are required for convergence. This renders analytical theory to be only approximately valid and hinders quantitative comparisons between the classical theory and simulations. In this paper, we derive a linear theory for the KHI with smooth profiles and illustrate code testing with the MHD code athena. We provide the linear solution for the KHI with smooth initial conditions in three different limits: inviscid hydrodynamics, ideal MHD, and Braginskii-MHD. These linear solutions are obtained numerically with the framework psecas (Pseudo-Spectral Eigenvalue Calculator with an Automated Solver), which generates and solves numerical eigenvalue problems using an equation-parser and pseudo-spectral methods. The athena simulations are carried out on a periodic, Cartesian domain which is useful for code testing purposes. Using psecas and analytic theory, we outline the differences between this artificial numerical set-up and the KHI on an infinite Cartesian domain and the KHI in cylindrical geometry. We discuss several astrophysical applications, such as cold flows in galaxy formation and cold fronts in galaxy cluster mergers. psecas, and the linear solutions used for code testing, are publicly available and can be downloaded from the web.},

   abstract = {The Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability of two fluids of a plasma, streaming in opposite directions with the same velocity and in the presence of an external magnetic field, is investigated. The external magnetic field in both fluids are in different directions. The usual magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with anisotropic pressures are considered. The generalized pressure relation is used and two equations of state for two pressures are taken up in the problem. The equations are linearized and initially two different flow velocities are taken for the system. The problem is solved and a dispersion relation is obtained. It is found that the instability condition for the static configuration depends on the polytropic index of the pressure relations. The condition of instability is further obtained for MHD and Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) systems. For the nonstatic streaming configuration it is also found that growth rate of K-H instability depends on various polytropic indices and magnetic field. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

At Earth these surface waves are important along the dawn and dusk flanks of the magnetopause boundary while at Jupiter and Saturn the entire dayside magnetopause boundary can exhibit KH activity due to corotational flows in the magnetosphere. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves can be a major ingredient in the so-called viscous-like interaction with the solar wind. In this paper, we review the KH instability from the perspective of hybrid (kinetic ions, fluid electrons) simulations. Many of the simulations are based on parameters typically found at Saturn’s magnetopause boundary, but the results can be generally applied to any KH-unstable situation. The focus of the discussion is on the ion kinetic scale and implications for mass, momentum, and energy transport at the magnetopause boundary.},

Spatial intermittency is generally associated with formation of sharp gradients and coherent structures. The basic physics of structure generation is ideal, but when dissipation is present it is usually concentrated in regions of strong gradients. This essential feature of spatial intermittency in fluids has been shown recently to carry over to the realm of kinetic plasma, where the dissipation function is not known from first principles. Spatial structures produced in intermittent plasma influence dissipation, heating, and transport and acceleration of charged particles. Temporal intermittency can give rise to very long time correlations or a delayed approach to steady-state conditions, and has been associated with inverse cascade or quasi-inverse cascade systems, with possible implications for heliospheric prediction.},

It is now understood that these energy transfer channels, to some extent, are correlated with coherent structures. In particular, we find that different energy dissipation proxies, although not point-wise correlated, are concentrated in proximity to each other, for which they decorrelate in a few ion inertial scales. However, the energy dissipation proxies dominate at different scales. For example, there is an inertial range over which the third-order law is meaningful. Contributions from scale bands stemming from scale-dependent spatial filtering show that the energy exchange through j · E mainly results from large scales, while the energy conversion from fluid flow to internal through − (P · ∇) · u dominates at small scales.},

We show how the requirement that viscous effects on the dynamics of large-scale momentum and kinetic energy be negligible ---an inviscid criterion--- naturally supports a density weighted coarse-graining of the velocity field. Such a coarse-graining method is already known in the literature as Favre filtering; however its use has been primarily motivated by appealing modeling properties rather than underlying physical considerations. We also prove that kinetic energy injection can be localized to the largest scales by proper stirring, and argue that stirring with an external acceleration field rather than a body force would yield a longer inertial range in simulations. We then discuss the special case of buoyancy-driven flows subject to a spatially-uniform gravitational field. We conclude that a range of scales can exist over which the mean kinetic energy budget is dominated by inertial processes and is immune from contributions due to molecular viscosity and external stirring.},

   abstract = {About sixty years ago it was proposed that the solar wind entry and changes in magnetospheric magnetic topology via dayside magnetic reconnection initiate the magnetospheric convection over the poles. On the other hand, the quasi-viscous interaction via Kelvin-Helmholtz waves/vortices was proposed to lead to the solar wind entry and magnetospheric convection. Since then, the two processes have been thought to regulate the solar wind and earth’s magnetosphere coupling. However, their relative efficiency and importance leave a lot of room for enhanced and quantitative understanding. Kelvin-Helmholtz instability operating on the entire surface of the magnetopause also provide a place for not only solar wind transport but also energetic particle transport or escape, thus, being an efficient channel for two-way transport. Recent observations and simulations indicate that the flanks of the earth’s magnetosphere can act as a pathway to/from the central magnetotail current sheet. Possible causality between the flank-side dynamics and magnetotail current sheet stability has never been explored. In this paper we discuss our perspective on these unsolved areas of Heliophysics research with brief suggestions of observational and numerical approaches.},

Anisotropy, a typical property in the solar wind, challenges the applicability of the third-order law with the isotropic assumption. To shed light on the energy transfer process in the presence of anisotropy, we conducted direct numerical simulations of forced MHD turbulence with normal and hyper-viscosity under various strengths of the external magnetic field ( <inline-formula> <alternatives> <inline-graphic href="S0022112023007437_inline1.png" mime-subtype="png"/> <tex-math>$B_0$</tex-math> </alternatives> </inline-formula> ), and calculated three forms of third-order structure function with or without averaging of the azimuthal or polar angles with respect to <inline-formula> <alternatives> <inline-graphic href="S0022112023007437_inline2.png" mime-subtype="png"/> <tex-math>$B_0$</tex-math> </alternatives> </inline-formula> direction. Correspondingly, three estimated energy transfer rates were obtained. The result shows that the peak of normalized third-order structure function occurs at larger scales closer to the <inline-formula> <alternatives> <inline-graphic href="S0022112023007437_inline4.png" mime-subtype="png"/> <tex-math>$B_0$</tex-math> </alternatives> </inline-formula> direction, and the maximum of longitudinal transfer rates shifts away from the <inline-formula> <alternatives> <inline-graphic href="S0022112023007437_inline5.png" mime-subtype="png"/> <tex-math>$B_0$</tex-math> </alternatives> </inline-formula> direction at larger <inline-formula> <alternatives> <inline-graphic href="S0022112023007437_inline6.png" mime-subtype="png"/> <tex-math>$B_0$</tex-math> </alternatives> </inline-formula> . Compared with normal viscous cases, hyper-viscous cases can attain better separated inertial range, thus facilitating the estimation of the energy cascade rates. We find that the widespread use of the isotropic form of the third-order law in estimating the energy transfer rates is questionable in some cases, especially when the anisotropy arising from the mean magnetic field is inevitable. In contrast, the direction-averaged third-order structure function properly accounts for the effect of anisotropy and predicts the energy transfer rates and inertial range accurately, even at very high <inline-formula> <alternatives> <inline-graphic href="S0022112023007437_inline7.png" mime-subtype="png"/> <tex-math>$B_0$</tex-math> </alternatives> </inline-formula> .

Coupling between the two components of kinetic energy by the advection term is relatively weak, and most energy introduced to either component by the external force is transferred, without passing through the other component, to internal nergy. A statistically quasiequilibrium of kinetic energy is realized while internal energy increases steadily.

   abstract = { A general stability analysis is performed for the Kelvin‐Helmholtz instability in sheared magnetohydrodynamic flow of finite thickness in a compressible plasma. The analysis allows for arbitrary orientation of the magnetic field B 0 , velocity flow v 0 , and wave vector k in the plane perpendicular to the velocity gradient, and no restrictions are imposed on the sound or Alfvén Mach numbers. The stability problem is reduced to the solution of a single second‐order differential equation, which includes a gravitational term to represent coupling between the Kelvin‐Helmholtz mode and the interchange mode. In the incompressible limit it is shown that the Kelvin‐Helmholtz mode is completely stabilized for any velocity profile as long as the condition  is satisfied, where V 0 is the total velocity jump across the shear layer. Numerical results are obtained for a hyperbolic tangent velocity profile for the transverse ( B 0 ⊥ v 0 ) and parallel ( B 0 ∥ v 0 ) flow configurations. Only modes with k Δ < 2 are unstable, where Δ is the scale length of the shear layer. The fastest growing modes occur for k Δ ∼ 0.5‐1.0. Compressibility and a magnetic field component parallel to the flow are found to be stabilizing effects. For the transverse case, only the fast magnetosonic mode is destabilized, but if k · B 0 ≠ 0, the instability contains Alfvén‐mode and slow‐mode components as well. The Alfvén component gives rise to a field‐aligned current inside the shear layer. In the parallel case, both Alfvén and slow magnetosonic components are present, with the Alfvén mode confined inside the shear layer. The results of the analysis are used to discuss the stability of sheared plasma flow at the magnetopause boundary and in the solar wind. At the magnetopause boundary, the fastest growing Kelvin‐Helmholtz mode has a frequency of 0 ( V 0 /2Δ), which overlaps with the frequency range of geomagnetic pulsations (Pc 3‐5). It is suggested that the MHD Kelvin‐Helmholtz instability could serve as a dynamo process driving small‐scale field‐aligned currents in the presence of the sheared plasma flow in the magnetosphere. },

   abstract = {To understand the turbulent generation of large-scale magnetic fields and to advance beyond purely kinematic approaches to the dynamo effect like that introduced by Steenbeck, Krause & Radler (1966)’ a new nonlinear theory is developed for three-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic, incompressible MHD turbulence with helicity, i.e. not statistically invariant under plane reflexions. For this, techniques introduced for ordinary turbulence in recent years by Kraichnan (1971 a)’ Orszag (1970, 1976) and others are generalized to MHD; in particular we make use of the eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian approximation. The resulting closed equations for the evolution of the kinetic and magnetic energy and helicity spectra are studied both theoretically and numerically in situations with high Reynolds number and unit magnetic Prandtl number. Interactions between widely separated scales are much more important than for non-magnetic turbulence. Large-scale magnetic energy brings to equipartition small-scale kinetic and magnetic excitation (energy or helicity) by the ‘Alfvén effect’; the small-scale ‘residual’ helicity, which is the difference between a purely kinetic and a purely magnetic helical term, induces growth of large-scale magnetic energy and helicity by the ‘helicity effect’. In the absence of helicity an inertial range occurs with a cascade of energy to small scales; to lowest order it is a −3/2 power law with equipartition of kinetic and magnetic energy spectra as in Kraichnan (1965) but there are −2 corrections (and possibly higher ones) leading to a slight excess of magnetic energy. When kinetic energy is continuously injected, an initial seed of magnetic field will grow to approximate equipartition, at least in the small scales. If in addition kinetic helicity is injected, an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity is obtained leading to the appearance of magnetic energy and helicity in ever-increasing scales (in fact, limited by the size of the system). This inverse cascade, predicted by Frisch et al. (1975), results from a competition between the helicity and Alféh effects and yields an inertial range with approximately — 1 and — 2 power laws for magnetic energy and helicity. When kinetic helicity is injected at the scale linj and the rate [formula omitted] (per unit mass), the time of build-up of magnetic energy with scale L ≫ linj is [formula omitted]. © 1976, Cambridge University Press.

It is understood that implementations may be limited by the quantity of available data and by the lack of turbulence symmetry. Assessment of the accuracy and feasibility of such third-order (or Yaglom) relations is most effectively accomplished by examining the von Kármán–Howarth equation in increment form, a framework from which the third-order laws are derived as asymptotic approximations. Using this approach, we examine the context of third-order laws for incompressible MHD in some detail. The simplest versions rely on the assumption of isotropy and the presence of a well-defined inertial range, while related procedures generalize the same idea to arbitrary rotational symmetries. Conditions for obtaining correct and accurate values of the dissipation rate from these laws based on several sampling and fitting strategies are investigated using results from simulations. The questions we address are of particular relevance to sampling of solar wind turbulence by one or more spacecraft. },

We focus on two distinguishing feature of the code: patch-based load balancing using space-filling curves, and support for Nvidia GPUs, which achieves substantial speed-up of up to more than 6x on the Cray XK7 architecture compared to a CPU-only implementation.},
