I fully deserve to be happy and I am continuously making progress at my own pace to continue to live my dream. I look forward to many things and I can't let one hard things ruin my entire week/weekend. I am a fully grown ass adult that can prioritize and do important and meaningful things. I get too hard on myself at times and that just means that I care, but I need to be level headed for myself. I may not be the best physicist or anything, but the effort counts so much more than anything. I need to remind myself that I am still doing well even though I get negative feedback. I am still growing and have lots of potential. I just can't overthink it. There are so many people that would love to be at UD in the group I am in and I get this opportunity to do really cool things. I am so blessed to be in my position and I am thankful for the people in my group. They are not scary, but they are hard on me because they want me to do well.
