Needs:
- Food
	- Yogurt
	- Milk
- Rest
- Calmness in mind

Worries:
- Imagining myself talking to Bill about research
	- Elena: He said on Friday that it looks like I have enough and I can just pose questions for further investigation
- Not doing enough for Fan
	- Elena: Fan is only trying to help me and he is understanding of my issues and understands that my focus is the RRE
- Being embarrassed in front of the committee
	- Elena: I will have practice in front of many peers before I go to present the RRE. So I will have it essentially given from memory. I will be prepared for it
