Today was a scary day, but I didn't panic. I think I get overwhelmed with work when it is the weekend and I don't feel like working, but I have to. I did get some very minor stuff done. I would really enjoy being able to delve deep into problems. I think one way to do this would be to document the papers I read. This would help me to derive equations. I also need to go back to textbooks to get the original derivation for equations. Overall, it was a fun day and I went to the reservoir. I just wish I could get really in depth to theoretical papers that require lots of dedicated attention.

I also feel as though I waste my time on lots of unnecessary things like youtube and twitch etc. It would be good to set time limits on these so that I can make sure I do things I actually want to do in my free time. I need to be able to get working on sketching, video games, and other things that provide better mental health. Maybe I need to plan the night before when I should do these things. A timeblock may not help, but more a loose schedule of when to do them during the day.
