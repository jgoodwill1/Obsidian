Today went really well. I managed my time well, went to the gym, and talked with Bill. I didn't have much anxiety about anything because I am coming to realize that everything tends to work out in the end. I have many awesome things to look forward to. Tomorrow I am excited to go to the gym again and work on more simulations. I feel that my goals are manageable and will keep my brain stimulated (plus I can learn a lot along the way). Elena has been wonderful to me and gives me so much attention. I have been loving life recently, but I am not sure what is causing this reflection.
