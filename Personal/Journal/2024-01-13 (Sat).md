Elena: 
Dear my love,

I have been thinking about our life together and I have not been happier. I really feel like I am becoming myself again recently and it makes me want to do so many awesome things for you. I cannot wait for my trip to NYC so soon. We can have a few days to have our time together and visit new places in the city <3. It will be so awesome. We definitely need to visit the natural history museum if youre not tired of it already. Our dates will be incredible to the cheese place and cocktail bar. I have been daydreaming about it ðŸ˜€. 

I'm so glad you're using all your gifties from me! It's so great that theyre a useful addition to your life (especially the Kindle, tbh kinda jealous). I would love to read books with you eventually and we could have our little book club together.

I hope you like the new setup of my room. I have been feeling super cozy in it since I can curl up in the corner. I'm so excited to 100% Hogwarts Legacy the next time you're here. I may need to find another game for us to play!!

Until I see you again, my love
Josh
