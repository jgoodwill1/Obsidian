Today, I felt tired and procrastinated. I was not able to look at my RRE paper, but I was able to go to the grocery store and figure out budgeting with Elena. I felt productive in that general sense, but was unable to convince myself to study. Also, I did not go outside much. I would really like to wake up with a fresh mind and be able to go for a walk, have a cup of coffee, get some physical activity in. While today was good for mental health, I can't help but feel guilty for taking today off when I didn't intend to. I need to be grinding for these last few weeks.
