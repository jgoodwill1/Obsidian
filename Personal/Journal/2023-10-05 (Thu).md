Today went pretty well. I made some progress on my RRE and I talked to a few people about mental health things. I really see so many expectations from others and previous graduate students. I want to know I am on the same path, but I also think that I should be forming my own path a bit. I don't need to be like them. They are not me and I can work on projects that I think are fun and useful. I just need to have reasoning behind them. I think I have worked well on the RRE and it is ready to show people.
